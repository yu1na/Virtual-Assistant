Using the Adlerian theory, this paper will \nshow what the important goals need to be set for Margarita’s treatment as well \nas the interventions that would best suit her case. Using interviews, subjective \nand objective, as well as early memory recollection, you will see how \nMargaritas problems can be successfully addressed and treated with the usage \nof Adlerian practices. Also, an understanding of the cultural considerations and \nlimitations will be gained. The pros and cons of the Adlerian model of \ncounseling are discussed and it is shown that the pros outweigh the cons of \nusing this method on a Hispanic person.\nAdlerian Theory and the Case of Margarita\nMargarita comes to therapy with presenting concerns of aggression and anger \nas well as depression and social anxiety. This section of the paper will address \nMargaritas issues from the view of Adlerian theory. Goals will be establishes for \nMargarita using this theory and interventions from the Adlerian perspective will \nbe applied as well. Being from Puerto Rico, there are some cultural \nconsiderations that come into play in this case and those will be addressed \nalong with any limitations that the Adlerian theory may have in successfully \ntreating Margarita.\nEstablishing Goals for Margarita\nThe most basic goal of Adlerian therapy is to challenge client’s premises and \nlife goals. “Adlerian Therapy is a growth model. It stresses a positive view of \n@2025 11 19\n\nhuman nature and that we are in control of our own fate and not a victim to it.” \n(PsyWEB, 2011). By reading Margarita’s case study it is clear that she is in need \nof growth and a more positive view of herself. She admits to feeling depressed \nmost of the time yet not expressing those feelings outwardly. She states the \nreason for this is that she has responsibilities and must put on her game face to \ntake\ncare of what she needs to take care of (kids, work, and school). Margarita also \nadmits to having anger issues without being able to pinpoint the cause of her \nanger. She appears to have isolated herself as she states she has no friends \nand feels fearful of social situations. Ironically though, Margarita belongs to \nmany organizations and committees where she must take charge and show \nstrength and ability. She admits that in these situations she feels in her element \nand in control though as far as gaining friends from these experiences, she \ndoes not feel worthy of such relationships. Knowing these things allows for \ngoal setting to begin.\nIn the case of Margarita there are four specific goals that the therapist should \nwork towards; encouraging a view of equality, changing of lifestyle, decreasing \nfeelings of inferiority, and changing faulty thinking and motivations. With the \nissues in Margarita’s life it is clear that she employs faulty thinking that leads \nher to feelings of inferiority. “For those of us who strive to be accomplished \nwriters, powerful business people, or influential politicians, it is because of our \nfeelings of inferiority and a strong need to overcome this negative part of us \naccording to Adler.” (Heffner, 2002).\nMargarita is striving to become successful in her own right and this is apparent \nthrough her work with the community boards and her recent acceptance into \nlaw school which is a prestigious honor. Even with these accomplishments \nMargarita still does not feel equal to her peers or good enough to be where she \nis in life and this is in part due to faulty thinking patterns. One of the most \nimportant goals, however, will be to find ways to overcome her outbursts of \nanger. By looking into the rest of her issues, the root of these outbursts should \nbecome more apparent and therefore targeted for removal and/or control.\nIntervention and Techniques\nDuring the therapeutic process, various techniques are used in order to help \nMargarita. One technique that is not special to her case is encouragement. \n“Encouragement is the most powerful method available for changing a person’s \nbeliefs, for it helps clients build self-confidence and stimulates courage.” \n(Corey, 2009, pg 105).

However, Adlerian therapy would be a good fit. \nAdler was ahead of his times in respect to social equality and cultural \nconsiderations. “Adlerian counseling takes into account the social and cultural \nvalues of minority groups, such as social embeddedness, integration of family \nmembers, and spirituality into the counseling process.” (Bornsheuer, & Polonyi, \n2011). These are the reasons that Adlerian therapy could be a successful fit \nwith Margarita.\nThough Adlerian therapy typically does fit will in cross cultural situations there \ncan be limitations as well depending on the client and how deeply rooted their \ncultural beliefs are. The only limitation that the counselor can see getting in the \nway of successful treatment of Margarita is that many times Hispanic families \ncan be close-mouthed when it comes to sharing personal information with \nthose outside their family circle. In her case study it states that the only people \nwho see her depression and angry side are her husband and her parents. This \ntells the counselor that there is a possibility that Margarita’s culture, having \ntaught her to be silent with strangers, may stop her from being completely \ncandid about her life which would stunt the success of her treatment.\nConclusion\nThe emotional and behavioral issues that brought Margarita to therapy can be \nidentified and treated successfully using Adlerian therapy. The goals set forth \nat the beginning of the therapeutic relationship were taken from her initial \npresentation, and using the techniques (early memories, interviews, \nreeducation) that are typical of Adlerian therapy, the counselor was able to \nshow how treatment with this model could be successful for Margarita’s case. \nWhile there is a clear limitation due to cultural issues, the counselor feels that \nAdlerian therapy would be a good match for Margarita.",
