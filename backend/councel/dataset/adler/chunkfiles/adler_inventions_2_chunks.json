    "text": "1. INTRODUCTION \n \nCounseling as a concept has been defined as a \nlearning process in which a person (client) who \nhas behavioural or adjustment problem is helped \nby a professional (Counsellor) to behave in a \nrewarding manner. Counseling involves a face to \nface or person to person interaction aimed at \nassisting “normal” individuals to overcome their \nstressful incapacitating situations. Meanwhile a \ntheory is an attempt at synthesizing and \nintegrating \nempirical \ndata \nmaximum \nclarification and unification. A theory permits the \npostulation and prediction of the occurrence of \nphenomena, and acts as a guide to discovering \nnew facts [1]. Therefore a counseling theory is an \nindividual’s view of the nature of man to serve as \na guide in helping troubled people [2,3]. Hence \namong numerous counseling theories, Alfred \nAdler’s individual psychology has stood out in its \ncontribution to the practice of counselling and \npsychotherapy. \n \nA look into his origin reveals that Alfred Adler \nwas born in the suburbs of Vienna in 1870, the \nthird child and second son of a Jewish grain \nmerchant and his wife. As a child, Alfred \ndeveloped rickets, which kept him from walking \nuntil he was four years old; and at five, he nearly \ndied of pneumonia. It was however reported that \nhe resolved to be a physician at about this age \n[4]. \n \nAlfred was an average student and preferred \nplaying outdoors to being cooped up in school. \nHe was quite outgoing, popular, and active, and \nwas known for his efforts at outdoing his older \nbrother, Sigmund [5]. He later received a medical \ndegree from the University of Vienna in 1895. \nDuring his college years, he became attached to \na group of socialist students, among whom he \nfound his wife-to-be, Raissa Timofeyewa Epstein \nwho was an intellectual and social activist from \nRussia studying in Vienna. They got married in \n1897, had four children, two of whom became \npsychiatrists. Alfred began his medical career as \nan ophthalmologist, but soon switched to general \npractice, and established his office in a lowerclass part of Vienna, across from the Prater, a \ncombination amusement park and circus. \n \nCooper [6] noted that the unusual strengths and \nweaknesses of the performers led to his insight \ninto organ inferiorities and compensation. He \nthen turned to psychiatry, and in 1907 was \ninvited to join Freud’s discussion group. After \nwriting papers on organic inferiority, which were \nquite compatible with Freud’s views, Alfred \nwrote, first, a paper concerning an aggression \ninstinct, which Freud did not approve of, and then \na paper on children’s feelings of inferiority, which \nsuggested that Freud’s sexual notions be taken \nmore metaphorically than literally [4]. \n \nCarew Alfred [7] noted that although Freud \nnamed Adler the president of the Viennese \nAnalytic Society and the co-editor of the \norganization’s newsletter, Adler did not stop his \ncriticism. A debate between Adler’s supporters \nand Freud’s was arranged, but it resulted in \nAdler, with nine others resigning to establish the \nsociety for Free Psychoanalysis in 1911. This \norganization became The Society for Individual \nPsychology in 1912. During World War I, Adler \nserved as a physician in the Austrian Army, first \non the Russian front and later in a children’s \nhospital.

    "text": "nor heredity determines behavior solely, but the \ninteraction of the environment, heredity and the \nindividual does. \n \nIn view of this fact, this paper looked at: the basic \ntenets of individual Psychology, Adler’s central \nconcepts and views of human nature, his \nexplanations of abnormal behaviours, and goals \ntherapy, \ntherapeutic \ntechniques \napproach and applicability of the theory to \nNigerian life situation. \n \n2. BASIC \nTENETS \nINDIVIDUAL \nPSYCHOLOGY \n \n1. The Individual is seen as a unified and \nself-consistent \nentity: \nThe \nterm \n“individual” stem from the Latin sense \n“indivisible”. To Adler, no life expression \ncan be viewed in isolation, but must always \nbe regarded in relation to the total \npersonality. The person is an indivisible \nunit both in mind and body and to the \nvarious activities and functions of the mind. \n2. Human life as a dynamic force striving \nfor perfection: Adler postulates a single \n“drive” or motivating force behind all our \nbehavior and experience. By the time his \ntheory had gelled into its most mature \nform, he called that motivating force, the \n“striving for perfection”. It is the desire we \nall have to fulfill our potentials to come \ncloser and closer to our ideal. \n3. Teleology: Adler sees motivation as a \nmatter of moving towards the future, rather \nthan being driven, mechanistically by the \npast. We are drawn towards our goals, our \npurposes, \nour \nideals; \nthis \ncalled \nteleology. Thus teleology acknowledges \nthat life is hard and uncertain, but it always \nhas room for change! \n4. The Individual is seen as a creative and \nself-determined entity: To him, people \npossess creative power, which places \nthem in control of their life; conscious \nactivity is the defining character of human \nbeings. This creative power affects virtually \nevery facet of the person’s existence — \nperception, memory, imagination, fantasy \nand dreaming. \n5. The \nembeddedness \nindividual: Adler sees the individual as an \nintegral part of a larger system — the \nfamily, community and humanity. Thus \nevery individual has the innate ability to \nengage in cooperative reciprocal social \nrelations. \n6. Individual \nsubjectivity: \nBehaviour \nalways dependent on people’s opinions of \nthemselves and the environments with \nwhich they must cope - i.e. “schema of \napperception”. \nTo \nAdler, \npeople \nare \nmotivated by fictional goals [9]. \n \n3. ADLER’S CENTRAL CONCEPTS AND \nVIEWS OF HUMAN NATURE \n \nMallum [10,9] presented them through the \nfollowing general headings: \n \n1. The Structure of the Human Mind: Adler \nviews the human mind as holistic one; an \nentity that is unified both unconsciously \nand consciously. For him, man is not made \nup of Id, ego, and superego as put forward \nby Sigmund Freud. The person and the \nsituation are one. Soft determinism is the \nterm given to this view as compared to \nFreud’s hard determinism. \n2. Inferiority Feelings and Compensation: \nTo \nAdler \n[11], \norgan \ninferiority, \ni.e. \ncongenitally weak functioning organs can \nlead to striking accomplishment in a \nperson’s life. It can also lead to inferiority \ncomplex if the individual’s attempts to \ncompensate are unsuccessful.

    "text": "nor heredity determines behavior solely, but the \ninteraction of the environment, heredity and the \nindividual does. \n \nIn view of this fact, this paper looked at: the basic \ntenets of individual Psychology, Adler’s central \nconcepts and views of human nature, his \nexplanations of abnormal behaviours, and goals \ntherapy, \ntherapeutic \ntechniques \napproach and applicability of the theory to \nNigerian life situation. \n \n2. BASIC \nTENETS \nINDIVIDUAL \nPSYCHOLOGY \n \n1. The Individual is seen as a unified and \nself-consistent \nentity: \nThe \nterm \n“individual” stem from the Latin sense \n“indivisible”. To Adler, no life expression \ncan be viewed in isolation, but must always \nbe regarded in relation to the total \npersonality. The person is an indivisible \nunit both in mind and body and to the \nvarious activities and functions of the mind. \n2. Human life as a dynamic force striving \nfor perfection: Adler postulates a single \n“drive” or motivating force behind all our \nbehavior and experience. By the time his \ntheory had gelled into its most mature \nform, he called that motivating force, the \n“striving for perfection”. It is the desire we \nall have to fulfill our potentials to come \ncloser and closer to our ideal. \n3. Teleology: Adler sees motivation as a \nmatter of moving towards the future, rather \nthan being driven, mechanistically by the \npast. We are drawn towards our goals, our \npurposes, \nour \nideals; \nthis \ncalled \nteleology. Thus teleology acknowledges \nthat life is hard and uncertain, but it always \nhas room for change! \n4. The Individual is seen as a creative and \nself-determined entity: To him, people \npossess creative power, which places \nthem in control of their life; conscious \nactivity is the defining character of human \nbeings. This creative power affects virtually \nevery facet of the person’s existence — \nperception, memory, imagination, fantasy \nand dreaming. \n5. The \nembeddedness \nindividual: Adler sees the individual as an \nintegral part of a larger system — the \nfamily, community and humanity. Thus \nevery individual has the innate ability to \nengage in cooperative reciprocal social",

ADLER’S CENTRAL CONCEPTS AND \nVIEWS OF HUMAN NATURE \n \nMallum [10,9] presented them through the \nfollowing general headings: \n \n1. The Structure of the Human Mind: Adler \nviews the human mind as holistic one; an \nentity that is unified both unconsciously \nand consciously. For him, man is not made \nup of Id, ego, and superego as put forward \nby Sigmund Freud. The person and the \nsituation are one. Soft determinism is the \nterm given to this view as compared to \nFreud’s hard determinism. \n2. Inferiority Feelings and Compensation: \nTo \nAdler \n[11], \norgan \ninferiority, \ni.e. \ncongenitally weak functioning organs can \nlead to striking accomplishment in a \nperson’s life. It can also lead to inferiority \ncomplex if the individual’s attempts to \ncompensate are unsuccessful. To Adler, \ninferiority feelings are the motivational \nbasis for essentially all human striving; one \nattains progress from his attempt to \novercome \ninferiority \nfeelings, \nbe \nit \nimagined or real. Hence the feelings of \ninferiority not the defective organ motivate \npeople. Thus, inferiority by itself cannot \nproduce greatness; it must be combined \nwith talent, courage and social concern. \n \n4.

    "text": "needs. Their main concern in life is to get \nas much as possible from others. \nc. The Avoiding Type: Fearing failure more \nthan desiring success, their lives are \nmarked by the socially useless behavior of \nrunning from the tasks of life. \nd. The Socially Useful Type: They are \nsocially oriented and willing to cooperate \nwith others to master the tasks of life, while \nsimultaneously ministering to their own \nneeds and those of others. They see the \nthree major task of occupation, friendship \nand loves as social problems. \n \n5.1 Social Interest \n \nThe tendency of man to associate with his fellow \nhuman being or “striving for a form of community \nwhich it must be thought of as everlasting” is \nwhat Adler called social interest. [2] further \nexplained that Adlerian approach recognizes \nman as having an inherent quality of community \nor social interests such as friendship, love, \ntenderness, etc. and are the antidote for selfish \nstrivings for superiority. That man is able to \nexpress empathy for others even though he feels \ninterior. To Adler, mankind is moving into a \nhigher state and it is the responsibility of each \nindividual to advance this goal by struggling for \nperfection. \n \n5.2 Creative Self \n \nThis concept implies that each of us creates his \nown personality; we actively construct it out of \nour experiences and heredity. People are, in final \nanalysis, responsible for their destinies. It is the \ncreative self that gives the individual the capacity \nto select his actions and to direct which life he \nmay take. While heredity gives man certain traits \nand abilities, the environment affords man the \nchance to use or improve on the traits and \ncapacities that were inherited. The creative self, \nhelps man to utilize his environmental factors to \nimprove on the traits and capacities man \ninherited. \n \n5.3 Order of Birth \n \nAdler as observed by [15] was of the view that \ncertain life-styles often develop as a function of a \nperson’s ordinal position within the family and \nthat \nchildren \ndo \nnot \nhave \nsimilar \nenvironment even though they come from the \nsame parents and family background. The child’s \nperceptions of his situation and the meaning \nattached to such situation that accompany his \noccupied position determine the way his ordinal \nposition will influence his life-style. Adler was \ninterested in four of such ordinal positions, which \n[9] identified as the first-born, the second-born, \nthe youngest and the only child. \n \na. The first-born child: As the first, the \noldest and the only child, he enjoyed an \nenviable position for a while. At its arrival \nas the first and only child, the parents are \nthrilled and committed to meeting its \nneeds. With the arrival of the second child, \nthe firstborn feels like a king dethroned. \nThis traumatic experience makes him to \nfight back to regain his lost glory within the \nfamily which never succeeds. Finally, the \nfirst-born tends to withdraw and feel \nisolated. \nb. The Second-born child: From the very \nbeginning, \nsecond \nchild \nhas \npacesetter in the older brother or sister and \nhe or she is thus challenged to outdo the \nolder \nchild’s \nexploits. \noften \ncharacterized by being highly competitive \nand ambitious. \nc. The Youngest child: The youngest child \nnever \nexperienced \nshock \ndethronement like the first-born. He is \npampered by not only the parent but other \nsiblings and is regarded as the baby in the \nfamily. \nlacks \nsense \nindependence as he is always carried \nalong by older siblings. Adler also stated \nthat such a child experiences strong \nfeelings of inferiority. He thus posits that \nthe lastborn possesses an advantage of \nbeing highly motivated to surpass older \nsiblings. \nd.

The Avoiding Type: Fearing failure more \nthan desiring success, their lives are \nmarked by the socially useless behavior of \nrunning from the tasks of life. \nd. The Socially Useful Type: They are \nsocially oriented and willing to cooperate \nwith others to master the tasks of life, while \nsimultaneously ministering to their own \nneeds and those of others. They see the \nthree major task of occupation, friendship \nand loves as social problems. \n \n5.1 Social Interest \n \nThe tendency of man to associate with his fellow \nhuman being or “striving for a form of community \nwhich it must be thought of as everlasting” is \nwhat Adler called social interest. [2] further \nexplained that Adlerian approach recognizes \nman as having an inherent quality of community \nor social interests such as friendship, love, \ntenderness, etc. and are the antidote for selfish \nstrivings for superiority. That man is able to \nexpress empathy for others even though he feels \ninterior. To Adler, mankind is moving into a \nhigher state and it is the responsibility of each \nindividual to advance this goal by struggling for \nperfection. \n \n5.2 Creative Self \n \nThis concept implies that each of us creates his \nown personality; we actively construct it out of \nour experiences and heredity. People are, in final \nanalysis, responsible for their destinies. It is the \ncreative self that gives the individual the capacity \nto select his actions and to direct which life he \nmay take. While heredity gives man certain traits \nand abilities, the environment affords man the \nchance to use or improve on the traits and \ncapacities that were inherited. The creative self, \nhelps man to utilize his environmental factors to \nimprove on the traits and capacities man \ninherited. \n \n5.3 Order of Birth \n \nAdler as observed by [15] was of the view that \ncertain life-styles often develop as a function of a \nperson’s ordinal position within the family and \nthat \nchildren \ndo \nnot \nhave \nsimilar \nenvironment even though they come from the \nsame parents and family background.

Adler was \ninterested in four of such ordinal positions, which \n[9] identified as the first-born, the second-born, \nthe youngest and the only child. \n \na. The first-born child: As the first, the \noldest and the only child, he enjoyed an \nenviable position for a while. At its arrival \nas the first and only child, the parents are \nthrilled and committed to meeting its \nneeds. With the arrival of the second child, \nthe firstborn feels like a king dethroned. \nThis traumatic experience makes him to \nfight back to regain his lost glory within the \nfamily which never succeeds.

THERAPEUTIC \nTECHNIQUES \nINDIVIDUAL PSYCHOLOGY \n \nDuring therapy, Adler preferred to have everyone \nsitting up and talking face to face and to avoid \nappearing too authoritarian [4]. Thus, the \nfollowing techniques are advocated in Individual \nPsychology: \n \na) Interpretative Technique: In this, the \ntherapist interprets the hypotheses on the \nclient’s lifestyle to him. In fact, the Adlerian \napproach emphasizes the significance of \nhelping a client to have insight into his or \nher conditions. If this situation is to be \nachieved, the therapist should be simple, \ndirect and clear in explaining the client’s \nlifestyle to him or her. \nb) Comparative Technique: This involves \nthe use of empathy by the therapist and his \nimagining and communicating to the client \nthe goal the therapist will pursue if he were \nto be in the client’s position. The counselor \ntherapist \nalso \ncompares \neach \ninformation given by the client on his or her \nattitudes and physical problems that may \ncontribute to the formation of a life style. \nc) Close behavioral inspection technique: \nTo [12], this involves the therapist’s close \ninspection of how the client presents \nhimself from the very moment he comes in \ncontact with the therapist. \nd) Life history study technique: In this, data \nfrom the client’s life history are compared \nwith current events in the life of the client. \ne) Dream analysis technique: The client’s \ndreams are used to comb out his or her life \nstyle.

These adolescents have taken \nsolace in secret cultism and have become \nthorns in the society’s flesh. In such case, \nthe Adlerian approach of counseling no \ndoubt will be useful, we think. \n5. Nigerian parents also have a lot to learn \nfrom this theory which highlights the \nconsequences of either pampering or \nneglecting children. The ideas put forward \nby Adler on pampering and neglecting \nchildren will go a long way to help Nigerian \nparents to engage in parenting styles that \nare responsible. \n6. The Adlerian theory can be applied to \npeople with mistaken life style. Many \nNigerians have developed lifestyles that \ncannot create a just and egalitarian \nsociety, which is one of the objectives of \nthe Nigerian constitution. These Nigerians \nbehave in a way that can destroy the unity \ncountry; \nsuch \nas \nincessant \ncommunal and political crises in the \ncountry. \n7. This theory is useful to our society \nbecause we talk of self reliance in the \npolicy of education. The individual should \nbe encouraged to be self dependent using \nAdlerian \napproach. \nshould \nbe \ncounseled \nequipped \nthrough \neducation to understand himself and take \nup personal challenges of life. It is the \ncreative self that gives the individual the \ncapacity to select his actions and to direct \nwhich life he may take. \n8. Man is by nature a forward looking entity, a \ncreature with a positive image about the \nnature and what the future may hold in \nstock for him. It is a common saying that, \n“the young shall grow”. In fact, the fictional \ngoal, which Nigerians have chosen, is to \nhave a just and egalitarian society. \n9. In our daily activities, we see the Adlerian \ntheory in action; all human behaviors \ndepicts a sense of direction, i.e. a goal \noften pursued according to life pattern or \nstyle, individuals’ feeling of inferiority \npropels them towards new attainments and \nachievements of new status of superiority. \n10. Adler’s view of human nature pictures the \norder of birth in the family and the \ncharacteristics of each ordinal position of \nthe children, tapping from this idea the \ncounsellor, teacher, parents and significant \nothers will understand better on how to \nhandle or help a child for proper life \nadjustment. \n \n10. CRITICISMS \nINDIVIDUAL \nPSYCHOLOGY \n \n1. The Individual Psychology has been \ncriticized for relying extensively on the use \nof intellectual insight to help clients change \ntheir maladaptive behaviors. \n2. It is also criticized for overemphasizing the \ndetermination for human behavior by roles \nplayed by subjective experiences, an \nindividual interest, and values. \n3. Generally, it suffices to say that Adler’s \ntheory is comprehensive, although, like \nFreud’s theory, its motivational base is \nlimited. \n4. The \nconcepts in Adler’s theory are \ngenerally global in nature and poorly \ndefined. Example, some individuals are \nthought \nhave \n“proof \ncomplexes”. \nHowever, it is very difficult to measure the \nproof complex in people even if adequate \nmeasure is developed. \n5. The fact that there are only a few \nconstructs in the theory means that they \nare going to be applied in highly general \nand imprecise ways. \n6. Apart from the recent strong support for \nman’ of the ideas about birth order effects, \nmuch of his theory lies fallow and untested. \nHowever, current interest in measuring key \nconcepts \naugurs \nwell \neventual \nhypothesis testing.

The ideas put forward \nby Adler on pampering and neglecting \nchildren will go a long way to help Nigerian \nparents to engage in parenting styles that \nare responsible. \n6. The Adlerian theory can be applied to \npeople with mistaken life style. Many \nNigerians have developed lifestyles that \ncannot create a just and egalitarian \nsociety, which is one of the objectives of \nthe Nigerian constitution. These Nigerians \nbehave in a way that can destroy the unity \ncountry; \nsuch \nas \nincessant \ncommunal and political crises in the \ncountry. \n7. This theory is useful to our society \nbecause we talk of self reliance in the \npolicy of education. The individual should \nbe encouraged to be self dependent using \nAdlerian \napproach. \nshould \nbe \ncounseled \nequipped \nthrough \neducation to understand himself and take \nup personal challenges of life. It is the \ncreative self that gives the individual the \ncapacity to select his actions and to direct",

It is a common saying that, \n“the young shall grow”. In fact, the fictional \ngoal, which Nigerians have chosen, is to \nhave a just and egalitarian society. \n9. In our daily activities, we see the Adlerian \ntheory in action; all human behaviors \ndepicts a sense of direction, i.e. a goal \noften pursued according to life pattern or \nstyle, individuals’ feeling of inferiority \npropels them towards new attainments and \nachievements of new status of superiority. \n10. Adler’s view of human nature pictures the \norder of birth in the family and the \ncharacteristics of each ordinal position of \nthe children, tapping from this idea the \ncounsellor, teacher, parents and significant \nothers will understand better on how to \nhandle or help a child for proper life \nadjustment. \n \n10. CRITICISMS \nINDIVIDUAL \nPSYCHOLOGY \n \n1. The Individual Psychology has been \ncriticized for relying extensively on the use \nof intellectual insight to help clients change \ntheir maladaptive behaviors. \n2. It is also criticized for overemphasizing the \ndetermination for human behavior by roles \nplayed by subjective experiences, an \nindividual interest, and values. \n3. Generally, it suffices to say that Adler’s \ntheory is comprehensive, although, like \nFreud’s theory, its motivational base is \nlimited. \n4. The \nconcepts in Adler’s theory are \ngenerally global in nature and poorly \ndefined. Example, some individuals are \nthought \nhave \n“proof \ncomplexes”. \nHowever, it is very difficult to measure the \nproof complex in people even if adequate \nmeasure is developed. \n5. The fact that there are only a few \nconstructs in the theory means that they \nare going to be applied in highly general \nand imprecise ways. \n6. Apart from the recent strong support for \nman’ of the ideas about birth order effects, \nmuch of his theory lies fallow and untested. \nHowever, current interest in measuring key \nconcepts \naugurs \nwell \neventual \nhypothesis testing.
