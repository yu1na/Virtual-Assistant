Later in his career Adler became \nfocused on how people were being affected by social unrest, the wars, and \nthe anti-Semitism/ethnic conflict/nationalism in Europe (Hoffman, 1994).\nAdler also understood the many cultural differences of Europe as he \nattempted to deal with problems of misunderstanding between warring \nnations. Adler contended that so much strife and suffering could be avoided \nthrough a sound education. He saw many countries trying to work out \ntheir psychological issues, such as feelings of inferiority or insignificance, \nand lack of attention, through war (Bottome, 1939).\nAdlerians espouse a growth model, noting that one’s fate is never \nfixed or predetermined and that individuals are always in the process of \n“becoming.” The Adlerian psychotherapist believes that the person who \nis experiencing difficulties in living, or “psychopathology,” is not sick, but \ndiscouraged (Maniacci et al., 2014; Sperry, Carlson, Sauerheber, & Sperry, \n2015). The Adlerian psychotherapist also views their clients as capable of \nusing their creativity to choose alternative methods of dealing with life. \nPsychopathology is understood as based in mistaken notions and faulty \nassumptions, low social interest, discouragement, and ineffective lifestyle (Sperry et al., 2015). The task of counseling and psychotherapy then \nbecomes one of encouraging the client to develop more social interest and \ncreate a more effective lifestyle in order to master the tasks of life.\nIn practice, Adlerian psychotherapy is a psychoeducational, present/ \nfuture-oriented, and brief approach (Carlson, Watts, & Maniacci, 2006). \nThough classic Adlerian psychotherapy, which is akin to long-term psychoanalysis, is still practiced in some circles, this book focuses on a modern \nand contemporary approach of Adlerian psychotherapy that is consistent \nwith other approaches that are more time-limited. Adlerian ideas and \nmethods have been effectively applied across the full range of settings (e.g., \ncommunity agencies, schools, business, child guidance centers, hospitals/ \nmedical centers, prisons, homes, private practice). The theory has been \ncharacterized as “commonsense” or “blue collar,” yet it is still not commonly \npracticed as Adler intended and modeled. While the fundamental principles \n\nof Adlerian psychology have remained the same, new techniques and \napplications continue to arise, and the theory continues to evolve into the \n21st century.\nAs one will discover when reading other books in the Theories of Psycho­\ntherapy Series, Adler’s original ideas serve as a foundation for most modern \ntheories of counseling and psychotherapy. Most of today’s prominent theories of psychotherapy, including person-centered therapy, existential therapy, \ncognitive therapy, rational emotive behavioral therapy, logotherapy, strategic \ntherapy, constructivist therapy, positive psychology, and family therapy, can \nfind their roots in Adlerian ideas (Carlson et al., 2006; DeRobertis, 2011; \nWatts, 1998, 2000b, 2012; Watts & Critelli, 1997; Watts & LaGuardia, 2015; \nWatts & Phillips, 2004). Adlerian theory espouses a philosophy of human \nrelations based upon social equality and emphasizes the influence of contextual factors. Further, as a psychoeducational model, Adlerian ideas can be \napplied in individual, group, couples, and family counseling as well as in the \nclassroom and at the community level. As such, Adlerian theory is uniquely \npositioned as a complete and effective approach to meet the expanding needs \nof diverse clients across multiple settings (Carlson & Englar-Carlson, 2012). \nWe believe that therapists should not ask themselves if they are an Adlerian, \nbut just “how” Adlerian they really are.\nThis book provides a comprehensive review of modern Adlerian \npsychotherapy. In the next chapter, we describe the historical tenets of \nthe Adlerian approach as a means of providing the foundation for better \nunderstanding of the theory (Chapter 3) and the therapeutic process of \nAdlerian therapy (Chapter 4). These chapters highlight the process and \npractice of this approach, including a variety of case examples. The fifth \nand sixth chapters look at the research support and the future direction \nof this important approach. Finally, a short summary, appendix, glossary, \nand suggestions for further study are provided.",
