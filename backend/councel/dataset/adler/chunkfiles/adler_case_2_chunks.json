    "text": "Natural and Logical Consequences \nIP theory suggests that to encourage an individual to take responsibility, allowing natural \nand logical consequences may be the best course of action (Murdock, 2017). In this case, natural \nconsequences could easily be applied. The client’s father could allow the client to continue his \ncurrent trajectory and squander any remaining hope to become the heir of the father’s fortune and \nthe CEO of Madison Hotels. Logical consequences were already set in place for this particular \ncase. There was an agreement with the client and the client’s father, that if the client did not \nprove himself to be psychologically, emotionally, and academically fit, then the client would \nforfeit any chance of becoming the next CEO of Madison Hotel. Natural and logical \nconsequences may help the client realize the severity of the situation when the client experiences \nsaid consequences. \nActing as If \nThe client, being a 27-year-old male, behaviorally resembles an adolescent. The acting as \nif technique, proposed by IP theory, calls for the client to act accordingly to an “if only” \nstatement (Murdock, 2017). For example, the client could ask himself, “If only I behaviorally, \npsychologically and emotionally behaved as a CEO,” the client may alter his self-perception \n(Murdock, 2017). Additionally, the “if only” technique allows for the client to explore behaviors \nthat the client has yet to discover (Murdock, 2017), which the client would benefit from in this \ncase if he discovered he had similar CEO qualities to his father. \nCreating Images \nThe client’s relationship with his father is shaky at best. The father has been pampering \nthe client all the client’s life and the client shows little to no respect for his father. This dynamic \nseems to be fostering an unhealthy relationship between the two. A therapeutic technique in the \n\ntoolkit of IP theory that could assist the client is creating images (Murdock, 2017). Creating \nimages allows the client to review his faulty perceptions and goals. Perhaps having the client \ncreate images relating to his disrespect of his father may allow the client to realize the conflict \nbetween them. \nSpiritual Application \nGiven that the client does not take other dimensions of his life seriously, incorporating \nanother dimension, namely spiritual, into the therapy process may prove to be difficult. As \npreviously mentioned, the client behaves like an adolescent despite being 27 years old. \nAdditionally, on account that the client has been overwhelmed with the severity of having to \nmature across multiple domains, it may be a good idea to approach spiritual matters differently. \nPerhaps, if the client was remotely interested in spirituality, then approaching it more \nlightheartedly may prove to be effective. \nThere is no debate that psychotherapy and Christianity have been at odds for decades \n(Jones & Butman, 2011; Kanz, 2001; Watts, 2000). If one were to strip each to their core, one \ncould conclude both are very similar in striving to understand, help, and foster healthy \nbiopsychosocial development for the individual (Jones & Butman, 2011). As each of these have \nan analogous foundational purpose, and no two philosophies are absolutely congruent, there will \nbe both incompatibilities and compatibilities. \nSpeaking first on compatibilities, a main compatibility between IP theory and Christianity \nis the family’s impact on one’s individual biopsychosocial development. As discussed by \nMurdock (2017), the influence of the family upon an individual is critically important. Likewise, \nthe Word of God references the importance of developing and training a child in accordance with",

    "text": "Natural and Logical Consequences \nIP theory suggests that to encourage an individual to take responsibility, allowing natural \nand logical consequences may be the best course of action (Murdock, 2017). In this case, natural \nconsequences could easily be applied. The client’s father could allow the client to continue his \ncurrent trajectory and squander any remaining hope to become the heir of the father’s fortune and \nthe CEO of Madison Hotels. Logical consequences were already set in place for this particular \ncase. There was an agreement with the client and the client’s father, that if the client did not \nprove himself to be psychologically, emotionally, and academically fit, then the client would \nforfeit any chance of becoming the next CEO of Madison Hotel. Natural and logical \nconsequences may help the client realize the severity of the situation when the client experiences \nsaid consequences. \nActing as If \nThe client, being a 27-year-old male, behaviorally resembles an adolescent. The acting as \nif technique, proposed by IP theory, calls for the client to act accordingly to an “if only” \nstatement (Murdock, 2017). For example, the client could ask himself, “If only I behaviorally, \npsychologically and emotionally behaved as a CEO,” the client may alter his self-perception \n(Murdock, 2017). Additionally, the “if only” technique allows for the client to explore behaviors \nthat the client has yet to discover (Murdock, 2017), which the client would benefit from in this \ncase if he discovered he had similar CEO qualities to his father. \nCreating Images \nThe client’s relationship with his father is shaky at best. The father has been pampering \nthe client all the client’s life and the client shows little to no respect for his father. This dynamic \nseems to be fostering an unhealthy relationship between the two. A therapeutic technique in the",

    "text": "toolkit of IP theory that could assist the client is creating images (Murdock, 2017). Creating \nimages allows the client to review his faulty perceptions and goals. Perhaps having the client \ncreate images relating to his disrespect of his father may allow the client to realize the conflict \nbetween them. \nSpiritual Application \nGiven that the client does not take other dimensions of his life seriously, incorporating \nanother dimension, namely spiritual, into the therapy process may prove to be difficult. As \npreviously mentioned, the client behaves like an adolescent despite being 27 years old. \nAdditionally, on account that the client has been overwhelmed with the severity of having to \nmature across multiple domains, it may be a good idea to approach spiritual matters differently. \nPerhaps, if the client was remotely interested in spirituality, then approaching it more \nlightheartedly may prove to be effective. \nThere is no debate that psychotherapy and Christianity have been at odds for decades \n(Jones & Butman, 2011; Kanz, 2001; Watts, 2000). If one were to strip each to their core, one \ncould conclude both are very similar in striving to understand, help, and foster healthy \nbiopsychosocial development for the individual (Jones & Butman, 2011). As each of these have \nan analogous foundational purpose, and no two philosophies are absolutely congruent, there will \nbe both incompatibilities and compatibilities. \nSpeaking first on compatibilities, a main compatibility between IP theory and Christianity \nis the family’s impact on one’s individual biopsychosocial development. As discussed by \nMurdock (2017), the influence of the family upon an individual is critically important. Likewise, \nthe Word of God references the importance of developing and training a child in accordance with",

    "text": "the principles of God’s Kingdom so that when he matures, he will not go astray (Proverbs 22:6, \nAMP). \nAnother compatibility between IP theory and Christianity is in the matter of taking care \nof and caring about society rather than the self. IP theory maintains that an individual can be \nmeasured by the degree to which the individual cares for society (Murdock, 2017; Kanz, 2001). \nAdditionally, discussed by Watts (2000), Alder’s conceptualization of manifesting religion was \nthe individual’s social interest. Both of these statements from Murdock (2017), Kanz (2001) and \nWatts (2000) align seamlessly with God’s Word cornering the outward love, care and compassion \nfor society (Galatians 6:10, AMP; 1 Timothy 5:8, AMP; James 1:27, AMP; Ephesians 4:32, \nAMP; John 13:34-35, AMP; 1 John 3:17-18, AMP; Matthew 25:40, AMP). \nA third compatibility between IP theory and Christianity surrounds a central component \nof the nature of IP theory: goals. Murdock (2017) and Watts (2000) outline that goals are utilized \nfor the individual to self-evaluate their current life developmental patterns in hopes that they \nrecognize their detrimental course and make the necessary corrections for a positive outcome. \nThe concept of self-evaluation in the psychological level of analysis is also highly recommended \nby the Word of God. The Apostle Paul, in his letter to the church at Rome, encourages believers \nto evaluate their cognitions and if necessary, realign them to foster a healthy psychospiritual \ndevelopmental outcome. \nIn regard to incompatibilities, as previously mentioned, no two philosophies will ever be \nabsolutely harmonious. Between IP theory and Christianity, one will not be surprised to discover \na number of incompatibilities. First, a critical incongruence is found between IP theory and \nChristianity’s foundational philosophical orientation of the human condition. IP theory purports \nthat humans can be inherently good or bad (Murdock, 2017; Kanz, 2001) while Christianity \n\nmaintains that all of humanity are inherently sinful and have wicked hearts (Psalm 51:5, AMP; \nRomans 5:12-21, AMP; Jeremiah 17:9, AMP). \nSecondly, IP theorists claim that, by the age of 5, an individual’s life trajectory, based off \nof several variables, is well established to carry throughout the rest of their life and is difficult to \nchange (Murdock, 2017). Although one can find various doctrinal positions related to \npredestination within Christianity, a common position held by the Pentecostal denomination and \nsome that claim non-denominationalism, is that of individual free will. The Word of God makes \nclear that an individual, if they will, has the ability to change the course of their life with a \nsimple decision, regardless of their childhood development (2 Corinthians 5:17, AMP; Matthew \n8:2-4, AMP; Deuteronomy 30:19, AMP; Isaiah 1:19, AMP; Deuteronomy 28:1, AMP). \nLastly, a third incompatibility between IP theory and Christianity surrounds a therapeutic \ntechnique of IP: paradoxical intention (Murdock, 2017). Paradoxical intention encourages the \nindividual to intensify the maladaptive behavior. In regards to Christianity, if one is struggling \nwith a sexual addition, the Word of God does not suggest that the individual should intensify that \nbehavior but rather seek God’s forgiveness and strength to overcome (1 John 1:9, AMP; \nEphesians 6:11, AMP). \nConclusion \n \nThe literature has indicated that IP theory is applicable for a variety of psychopathologies \n(Murdock, 2017; Sperry & Maniacci, 1992). With reference to this client, his presenting \nsymptomology is within the scope of IP theory’s psychotherapy toolkit. While the client is \nexhibiting symptoms of the peter pan condition (Peterson, 2017), the client could see a dramatic \npositive change undergoing IP therapy. The most challenging facet, in this case, would be \nhelping the client understand the consequences of both his actions and inactions. Among IP \n\ntheory’s therapeutic techniques, paradoxical intention and natural and logical consequences \ncould prove fairly successful in this regard. Even though the client has been resistant to previous \nsuggested treatments, IP theory looks to be a promising therapeutic orientation for this client.",
