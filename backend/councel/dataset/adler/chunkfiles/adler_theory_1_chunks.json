He attended public school in Vienna\nand then trained as a physician at the University of Vienna. Adler entered private\npractice as an ophthalmologist. A short time later he switched to general practice\nand then to neurology. In 1902, he was invited by Sigmund Freud to join the Vienna\nPsychoanalytic Society. Due to significant theoretical disagreement with Freud,\nAdler resigned from the Society in 1911 (Ellenberger, 1970; Hoffman, 1994). He\nspent the remainder of his life –he died in 1937– developing a personality theory and\napproach to counseling and psychotherapy so far ahead of his time that Albert Ellis\n(1970) declared, “Alfred Adler, more than even Freud, is probably the true father\nof modern psychotherapy” (p. 11). Corey (1996, 2005) stated that Adler’s most\nimportant contribution was his influence on other theoretical perspectives. Adler’s\ninfluence has been acknowledged by –or his vision traced to– neo-Freudian\napproaches, existential therapy, person-centered therapy, cognitive-behavioral\ntherapies, reality therapy, family systems approaches, and, more recently,\nconstructivist and social constructionist (e.g., solution-focused and narrative)\ntherapies (Oberst & Stewart, 2003; Watts, 1999; Watts & Critelli, 1997; Watts &\nPietrzak, 2000).\nUnfortunately, many scholars appear to be unaware of the evolution of Adler’s\ntheory. All too often, Adler is erroneously identified in the secondary source\nliterature as “neo-Freudian” and place alongside discussions of other psychoanalytic theories (Watts & Critelli, 1997). Although it is true that the neo-Freudians\nwere significantly influenced by Adler (Ellenberger, 1970), is not true that Adler’s\nIndividual Psychology was merely the first neo-Freudian position.\nWhen Maslow introduced his ‘third force,” subsequently known as “humanistic psychology,” he listed Adlerians first among the groups included\nand the Journal of Individual Psychology among the five journals where\nthese groups are most likely to publish. He also invited H. L. Ansbacher,\nas representing Adlerian psychology, to become a founding sponsor of the\nAssociation for Humanistic Psychology and member of the editorial board\nof the Journal of Humanistic Psychology.

In particular, I would like to address Adler’s thoughts on\nstriving for perfection or superiority and gemeinschaftsgefuhl (community feeling/\nsocial interest) as evincing Adlerian psychology’s position as arguably the first\npositive psychology in the 20th century (Watts, 2012).

He emphasized that persons cannot\nbe properly understood as a collection of parts (e.g., Freud), but rather should be\nviewed as a unity, as a whole. An integration of cognitive, existential-humanistic,\npsychodynamic, and systemic perspectives, Adlerian theory is a holistic, phenomenological, socially-oriented, and teleological (goal-directed) approach to understanding and working with people. It emphasizes the proactive, form-giving and\nfictional nature of human cognition and its role in constructing the “realities” that\npersons know and to which they respond. Adlerian theory asserts that humans\nconstruct, manufacture, or narratize ways of viewing and experiencing the world\nand then take these fictions for truth. It is an optimistic theory affirming that humans\nare not determined by heredity or environment. Rather, they are creative, proactive,\nmeaning-making beings, having the ability to choose and to be responsible for their\nchoices (Adler, 1956; Carlson, Watts, & Maniacci, 2006; Mosak & Maniacci, 1999;\nWatts, 1999; Watts & Shulman, 2003; Watts & Eckstein, 2009).\nAdler affirmed that humans are characterized by unity across the broad\nspectrum of personality—cognitions, affect, and behavior. Life style or style of life,\nthe Adlerian nomenclature for personality, is a cognitive blueprint or personal\nmetanarrative containing the person’s unique and individually created convictions,\ngoals and personal beliefs for coping with the tasks and challenges of life. This life\nplan is uniquely created by each person, begins as a prototype in early childhood,\nand is progressively refined throughout life.

This idea is\ninherent in the Adlerian construct known as the creative power of the self or the\ncreative self. Because of this creative power, people function like actors authoring\ntheir own scripts, directing their own actions, and constructing their own personalities within a socially-embedded context. Humans co-construct the realities to which\nthey respond (Watts & Shulman, 2003).\nStriving for Perfection or Superiority\nAdler’s understanding of “striving” evolved over time and he used various\nwords like completion, mastery, perfection, and superiority to describe how\nhumans seek to move from “the present situation, as observed and interpreted, to a\nbetter one, one that was superior to the present status” (Manaster & Corsini, 1982,\np. 41). According to Adler, the central human directionality is toward competence\nor self-mastery, what Adler called striving for perfection or superiority. This is the\nindividual’s creative and compensatory answer to the normal and universal feelings\nof insignificance and disempowerment, and the accompanying beliefs that one is\nless that what one should be (i.e., feelings of inferiority). Thus, striving for\nperfection or superiority is the natural human desire to move from a perceived\nnegative position to a perceived positive one.\nThis concept of striving or teleological/teleonomical movement is seen in the\nwritings of various personality theorists including Kurt Goldstein, Karen Horney,\nCarl Jung, Abraham Maslow, Otto Rank, Carl Rogers, and Robert White (Jorgensen\n& Nafstad, 2004; Manaster & Corsini, 1982). One can find similar ideas in various\ncontemporary theoretical perspectives, including constructivist, evolutionary, and\npositive psychologies (Linley & Joseph, 2004; Mahoney, 2003; Rasmussen, 2010;\nSnyder, Lopez, & Pedrotti, 2011). For example, in discussing happiness and human\npotential, Ryan and Deci (2001) described optimal functioning and development as\n“the striving for perfection the represents the realization of one’s true potential” (p.\n144). Ryan and Deci’s position is essentially verbatim to that of Adler’s Individual\nPsychology.\nAll of the aforementioned personality theorists agree with Adler that humans\nare striving, seeking to actualize potential, and in the process of “becoming”, and\nmost of the theories created by these theorists are listed as early exemplars of\npositive psychology in that literature. Adler’s theory, however, is not found in the\nvarious lists; the positive psychology literature typically lists Maslow and Rogers\nas the earliest exemplars, even though Adler clearly preceded both in his formulation of an optimistic, growth-oriented psychology.",

This idea is\ninherent in the Adlerian construct known as the creative power of the self or the\ncreative self. Because of this creative power, people function like actors authoring\ntheir own scripts, directing their own actions, and constructing their own personalities within a socially-embedded context. Humans co-construct the realities to which\nthey respond (Watts & Shulman, 2003).\nStriving for Perfection or Superiority\nAdler’s understanding of “striving” evolved over time and he used various\nwords like completion, mastery, perfection, and superiority to describe how\nhumans seek to move from “the present situation, as observed and interpreted, to a\nbetter one, one that was superior to the present status” (Manaster & Corsini, 1982,\np. 41). According to Adler, the central human directionality is toward competence\nor self-mastery, what Adler called striving for perfection or superiority. This is the\nindividual’s creative and compensatory answer to the normal and universal feelings\nof insignificance and disempowerment, and the accompanying beliefs that one is\nless that what one should be (i.e., feelings of inferiority). Thus, striving for\nperfection or superiority is the natural human desire to move from a perceived\nnegative position to a perceived positive one.\nThis concept of striving or teleological/teleonomical movement is seen in the\nwritings of various personality theorists including Kurt Goldstein, Karen Horney,\nCarl Jung, Abraham Maslow, Otto Rank, Carl Rogers, and Robert White (Jorgensen\n& Nafstad, 2004; Manaster & Corsini, 1982). One can find similar ideas in various\ncontemporary theoretical perspectives, including constructivist, evolutionary, and\npositive psychologies (Linley & Joseph, 2004; Mahoney, 2003; Rasmussen, 2010;\nSnyder, Lopez, & Pedrotti, 2011). For example, in discussing happiness and human\npotential, Ryan and Deci (2001) described optimal functioning and development as",
