George Boeree: Personality Theories  Alfred Adler\nIntroduction \nI would like to introduce Alfred Adler by talking about someone Adler never knew: Theodore Roosevelt. \nBorn to Martha and Theodore Senior in Manhattan on October 27, 1858, he was said to be a particularly \nbeautiful baby who needed no help entering his new world. His parents were strong, intelligent, handsome, \nand quite well-to-do. It should have been an idyllic childhood \nBut \"Teedie,\" as he was called, was not as healthy as he first appeared. He had severe asthma, and tended to \ncatch colds easily, develop coughs and fevers, and suffer from nausea and diarrhea. He was small and thin. \nHis voice was reedy, and remained so even in adulthood. He became malnourished and was often forced by \nhis asthma to sleep sitting up in chairs. Several times, he came dangerously close to dying from lack of \noxygen. \nNot to paint too negative a picture, Teedie was an active boy – some would say over-active – and had a \nfantastic personality. He was full of curiosity about nature and would lead expeditions of cousins to find \nmice, squirrels, snakes, frogs, and anything else that could be dissected or pickled. His repeated confinement \nwhen his asthma flared up turned him to books, which he devoured throughout his life. He may have been \nsickly, but he certainly had a desire to live! \nAfter traveling through Europe with his family, his health became worse. He had grown taller but no more \nmuscular. Finally, with encouragement from the family doctor, Roosevelt Senior encouraged the boy, now \ntwelve, to begin lifting weights. Like anything else he tackled, he did this enthusiastically. He got healthier, \nand for the first time in his life got through a whole month without an attack of asthma. \nWhen he was thirteen, he became aware of another defect of his: When he found that he couldn't hit anything \nwith the rifle his father had given him. When friends read a billboard to him – he didn't realize it had writing \non it – it was discovered that he was terribly nearsighted! \nIn the same year, he was sent off to the country on his own after a bad attack of asthma. On the way, he was \nwaylaid by a couple of other boys his own age. He found that not only couldn't he defend himself, he \ncouldn't even lay a hand on them. He later announced to his father his intention to learn to box. By the time \nhe went to Harvard, he was not only a healthier Teddy Roosevelt, but was a regular winner of a variety of \nathletic contests. \nThe rest, as they say, is history. \"Teedie\" Roosevelt went on to become a successful New York \nassemblyman, North Dakota cowboy, New York commissioner of police, Assistant secretary of the Navy, \nlieutenant colonel of the \"Rough Riders,\" the Governor of New York, and best-selling author, all by the age \nof forty. With the death of President William McKinley in 1901, Theodore Roosevelt became the youngest \npresident of the United States. \nHow is it that someone so sickly should become so healthy, vigorous, and successful? Why is it that some \nchildren, sickly or not, thrive, while others wither away? Is the drive that Roosevelt had peculiar to him, or is \nit something that lies in each of us? These kinds of questions intrigued a young Viennese physician named \nAlfred Adler, and led him to develop his theory, called Individual Psychology. \n3 | 14",

George Boeree: Personality Theories  Alfred Adler\nBiography \nAlfred Adler was born in the suburbs of Vienna on February 7, 1870, the third child, second son, of a Jewish \ngrain merchant and his wife. As a child, Alfred developed rickets, which kept him from walking until he was \nfour years old. At five, he nearly died of pneumonia. It was at this age that he decided to be a physician. \nAlfred was an average student and preferred playing outdoors to being cooped up in school. He was quite \noutgoing, popular, and active, and was known for his efforts at outdoing his older brother, Sigmund. \nHe received a medical degree from the University of Vienna in 1895. During his college years, he became \nattached to a group of socialist students, among which he found his wife-to-be, Raissa Timofeyewna Epstein. \nShe was an intellectual and social activist who had come from Russia to study in Vienna. They married in \n1897 and eventually had four children, two of whom became psychiatrists. \nHe began his medical career as an opthamologist, but he soon switched to general practice, and established \nhis office in a lower-class part of Vienna, across from the Prater, a combination amusement park and circus. \nHis clients included circus people, and it has been suggested (Furtmuller, 1964) that the unusual strengths \nand weaknesses of the performers led to his insights into organ inferiorities and compensation. \nHe then turned to psychiatry, and in 1907 was invited to join Freud's discussion group. After writing papers \non organic inferiority, which were quite compatible with Freud's views, he wrote, first, a paper concerning an \naggression instinct, which Freud did not approve of, and then a paper on children's feelings of inferiority, \nwhich suggested that Freud's sexual notions be taken more metaphorically than literally. \nAlthough Freud named Adler the president of the Viennese Analytic \nSociety and the co-editor of the organization's newsletter, Adler didn't \nstop his criticism. A debate between Adler's supporters and Freud's was \narranged, but it resulted in Adler, with nine other members of the \norganization, resigning to form the Society for Free Psychoanalysis in \n1911. This organization became The Society for Individual Psychology \nin the following year. \nDuring World War I, Adler served as a physician in the Austrian Army, \nfirst on the Russian front, and later in a children's hospital. He saw first \nhand the damage that war does, and his thought turned increasingly to \nhe concept of social interest. He felt that if humanity was to survive, it \nhad to change its ways! \nAfter the war, he was involved in various projects, including clinics \nattached to state schools and the training of teachers. In 1926, he went to \nthe United States to lecture, and he eventually accepted a visiting \nposition at the Long Island College of Medicine. In 1934, he and his \nfamily left Vienna forever. On May 28, 1937, during a series of lectures \nat Aberdeen University, he died of a heart attack. \n4 | 14",

    "text": "C. George Boeree: Personality Theories  Alfred Adler\nTheory \nAlfred Adler postulates a single \"drive\" or motivating force behind all our behavior and experience. By the \ntime his theory had gelled into its most mature form, he called that motivating force the striving for \nperfection. It is the desire we all have to fulfill our potentials, to come closer and closer to our ideal. It is, as \nmany of you will already see, very similar to the more popular idea of self-actualization. \n\"Perfection\" and \"ideal\" are troublesome words, though. On the one hand, they are very positive goals. \nShouldn't we all be striving for the ideal? And yet, in psychology, they are often given a rather negative \nconnotation. Perfection and ideals are, practically by definition, things you can't reach. Many people, in fact, \nlive very sad and painful lives trying to be perfect! As you will see, other theorists, like Karen Horney and \nCarl Rogers, emphasize this problem. Adler talks about it, too. But he sees this negative kind of idealism as a \nperversion of the more positive understanding. We will return to this in a little while. \nStriving for perfection was not the first phrase Adler used to refer to his single motivating force. His earliest \nphrase was the aggression drive, referring to the reaction we have when other drives, such as our need to \neat, be sexually satisfied, get things done, or be loved, are frustrated. It might be better called the \nassertiveness drive, since we tend to think of aggression as physical and negative. But it was Adler's idea of \nthe aggression drive that first caused friction between him and Freud. Freud was afraid that it would detract \nfrom the crucial position of the sex drive in psychoanalytic theory. Despite Freud's dislike for the idea, he \nhimself introduced something very similar much later in his life: the death instinct. \nAnother word Adler used to refer to basic motivation was compensation, or striving to overcome. Since we \nall have problems, short-comings, inferiorities of one sort or another, Adler felt, earlier in his writing, that \nour personalities could be accounted for by the ways in which we do – or don't – compensate or overcome \nthose problems. The idea still plays an important role in his theory, as you will see, but he rejected it as a \nlabel for the basic motive because it makes it sound as if it is your problems that cause you to be what you \nare. \nOne of Adler's earliest phrases was masculine protest. He noted something pretty obvious in his culture \n(and by no means absent from our own): Boys were held in higher esteem than girls. Boys wanted, often \ndesperately, to be thought of as strong, aggressive, in control – i.e. \"masculine\" – and not weak, passive, or \ndependent – i.e. \"feminine.\" The point, of course, was that men are somehow basically better than women. \nThey do, after all, have the power, the education, and apparently the talent and motivation needed to do \n\"great things,\" and women don't. \nYou can still hear this in the kinds of comments older people make about little boys and girls: If a baby boy \nfusses or demands to have his own way (masculine protest!), they will say he's a natural boy; If a little girl is \nquiet and shy, she is praised for her femininity; If, on the other hand, the boy is quiet and shy, they worry \nthat he might grow up to be a sissy; Or if a girl is assertive and gets her way, they call her a \"tomboy\" and \nwill try to reassure you that she'll grow out of it! \nBut Adler did not see men's assertiveness and success in the world as due to some innate superiority. He saw \nit as a reflection of the fact that boys are encouraged to be assertive in life, and girls are discouraged. Both \nboys and girls, however, begin life with the capacity for \"protest!\" Because so many people misunderstood \nhim to mean that men are, innately, more assertive, lead him to limit his use of the phrase. \nThe last phrase he used, before switching to striving for perfection, was striving for superiority. His use of \nthis phrase reflects one of the philosophical roots of his ideas: Friederich Nietzsche developed a philosophy \nthat considered the will to power the basic motive of human life. Although striving for superiority does refer \nto the desire to be better, it also contains the idea that we want to be better than others, rather than better in",

George Boeree: Personality Theories  Alfred Adler\nLife style\n \n \n \nA lot of this playing with words reflects Adler's groping towards a really different kind of personality theory \nthan that represented by Freud's. Freud' theory was what we nowadays would call a reductionistic one: He \ntried most of his life to get the concepts down to the physiological level. although he admitted failure in the \nend, life is nevertheless explained in terms of basic physiological needs. In addition, Freud tended to \"carve \nup\" the person into smaller theoretical concepts – the id, ego, and superego – as well. \nAdler was influenced by the writings of Jan Smuts, the South African philosopher and statesman. Smuts felt \nthat, in order to understand people, we have to understand them more as unified wholes than as a collection \nof bits and pieces, and we have to understand them in the context of their environment, both physical and \nsocial. This approach is called holism, and Adler took it very much to heart. \nFirst, to reflect the idea that we should see people as wholes rather than parts, he decided to label his \napproach to psychology individual psychology. The word individual means literally \"un-divided.\" \nSecond, instead of talking about a person's personality, with the traditional sense of internal traits, structures, \ndynamics, conflicts, and so on, he preferred to talk about style of life (nowadays, \"lifestyle\"). Life style \nrefers to how you live your life, how you handle problems and interpersonal relations. Here's what he \nhimself had to say about it: \"The style of life of a tree is the individuality of a tree expressing itself and \nmolding itself in an environment. We recognize a style when we see it against a background of an \nenvironment different from what we expect, for then we realize that every tree has a life pattern and is not \nmerely a mechanical reaction to the environment.\" \nTeleology\n \n \n \nThe last point – that lifestyle is \"not merely a mechanical reaction\" – is a second way in which Adler differs \ndramatically from Freud. For Freud, the things that happened in the past, such as early childhood trauma, \ndetermine what you are like in the present. Adler sees motivation as a matter of moving towards the future, \nrather than being driven, mechanistically, by the past. We are drawn towards our goals, our purposes, our \nideals. This is called teleology. \nMoving things from the past into the future has some dramatic effects. Since the future is not here yet, a \nteleological approach to motivation takes the necessity out of things. In a traditional mechanistic approach, \ncause leads to effect: If a, b, and c happen, then x, y, and z must, of necessity, happen. But you don't have to \nreach your goals or meet your ideals, and they can change along the way. Teleology acknowledges that life is \nhard and uncertain, but it always has room for change! \nAnother major influence on Adler's thinking was the philosopher Hans Vaihinger, who wrote a book called \nThe Philosophy of \"As If.\" Vaihinger believed that ultimate truth would always be beyond us, but that, for \npractical purposes, we need to create partial truths. His main interest was science, so he gave as examples \nsuch partial truths as protons an electrons, waves of light, gravity as distortion of space, and so on. Contrary \nto what many of us non-scientists tend to assume, these are not things that anyone has seen or proven to \nexist: They are useful constructs. They work for the moment, let us do science, and hopefully will lead to \nbetter, more useful constructs. We use them \"as if\" they were true. He called these partial truths fictions. \nVaihinger, and Adler, pointed out that we use these fictions in day to day living as well. We behave as if we \nknew the world would be here tomorrow, as if we were sure what good and bad are all about, as if everything \nwe see is as we see it, and so on. Adler called this fictional finalism. You can understand the phrase most \neasily if you think about an example: Many people behave as if there were a heaven or a hell in their \npersonal future. Of course, there may be a heaven or a hell, but most of us don't think of this as a proven fact. \nThat makes it a \"fiction\" in Vaihinger's and Adler's sense of the word. And finalism refers to the teleology of \nit: The fiction lies in the future, and yet influences our behavior today.",

There are, \nas you well know, many examples of people who overcame great physical odds to become what those who \nare better endowed physically wouldn't even dream of! \nSadly, there are also many people who cannot handle their difficulties, and live lives of quiet despair. I \nwould guess that our optimistic, up-beat society serious underestimates their numbers. \nBut Adler soon saw that this is only part of the picture. Even more people have psychological inferiorities. \nSome of as are told that we are dumb, or ugly, or weak. Some of us come to believe that we are just plain no \ngood. In school, we are tested over and over, and given grades that tell us we aren't as good as the next \nperson. Or we are demeaned for our pimples or our bad posture and find ourselves without friends or dates. \nOr we are forced into basketball games, where we wait to see which team will be stuck with us. In these \nexamples, it's not a matter of true organic inferiority – we are not really retarded or deformed or weak – but \nwe learn to believe that we are. Again, some compensate by becoming good at what we feel inferior about. \nMore compensate by becoming good at something else, but otherwise retaining our sense of inferiority. And \nsome just never develop any self esteem at all. \nIf the preceding hasn't hit you personally yet, Adler also noted an even more general form of inferiority: The \nnatural inferiority of children. all children are, by nature, smaller, weaker, less socially and intellectually \ncompetent, than the adults around them.

George Boeree: Personality Theories  Alfred Adler\ntheir deficiencies in some way: The inferior organ can be strengthened and even become stronger than it is in \nothers; Or other organs can be overdeveloped to take up the slack; Or the person can psychologically \ncompensate for the organic problem by developing certain skills or even certain personality styles. There are, \nas you well know, many examples of people who overcame great physical odds to become what those who \nare better endowed physically wouldn't even dream of! \nSadly, there are also many people who cannot handle their difficulties, and live lives of quiet despair. I \nwould guess that our optimistic, up-beat society serious underestimates their numbers. \nBut Adler soon saw that this is only part of the picture. Even more people have psychological inferiorities. \nSome of as are told that we are dumb, or ugly, or weak. Some of us come to believe that we are just plain no \ngood. In school, we are tested over and over, and given grades that tell us we aren't as good as the next \nperson. Or we are demeaned for our pimples or our bad posture and find ourselves without friends or dates. \nOr we are forced into basketball games, where we wait to see which team will be stuck with us. In these \nexamples, it's not a matter of true organic inferiority – we are not really retarded or deformed or weak – but \nwe learn to believe that we are. Again, some compensate by becoming good at what we feel inferior about. \nMore compensate by becoming good at something else, but otherwise retaining our sense of inferiority. And \nsome just never develop any self esteem at all. \nIf the preceding hasn't hit you personally yet, Adler also noted an even more general form of inferiority: The \nnatural inferiority of children. all children are, by nature, smaller, weaker, less socially and intellectually \ncompetent, than the adults around them. Adler suggested that, if we look at children's games, toys, and \nfantasies, they tend to have one thing in common: The desire to grow up, to be big, to be an adult. This kind \nof compensation is really identical with striving for perfection! Many children, however, are left with the \nfeeling that other people will always be better than they are.",

George Boeree: Personality Theories  Alfred Adler\nexamples are the people who are given to attention-getting dramatics, the ones who feel powerful when they \ncommit crimes, and the ones who put others down for their gender, race, ethnic origins, religious beliefs, \nsexual orientation, weight, height, etc. etc. Even more subtle still are the people who hide their feelings of \nworthlessness in the delusions of power afforded by alcohol and drugs.\nPsychological types\n \n \n \nAlthough all neurosis is, for Adler, a matter of insufficient social interest, he did note that three types could \nbe distinguished based on the different levels of energy they involved: \nThe first is the ruling type. They are, from childhood on, characterized by a tendency to be rather aggressive \nand dominant over others. Their energy – the strength of their striving after personal power – is so great that \nthey tend to push over anything or anybody who gets in their way. The most energetic of them are bullies \nand sadists; somewhat less energetic ones hurt others by hurting themselves, and include alcoholics, drug \naddicts, and suicides. \nThe second is the leaning type. They are sensitive people who have developed a shell around themselves \nwhich protects them, but they must rely on others to carry them through life's difficulties. They have low \nenergy levels and so become dependent. When overwhelmed, they develop what we typically think of as \nneurotic symptoms: phobias, obsessions and compulsions, general anxiety, hysteria, amnesias, and so on, \ndepending on individual details of their lifestyle. \nThe third type is the avoiding type. These have the lowest levels of energy and only survive by essentially \navoiding life – especially other people. When pushed to the limits, they tend to become psychotic, retreating \nfinally into their own personal worlds. \nThere is a fourth type as well: the socially useful type. This is the healthy person, one who has both social \ninterest and energy. Note that without energy, you can't really have social interest, since you wouldn't be able \nto actually do anything for anyone! \nAdler noted that his four types looked very much like the four types proposed by the ancient Greeks. They, \ntoo, noticed that some people are always sad, others always angry, and so on. But they attributed these \ntemperaments (from the same root as temperature) to the relative presence of four bodily fluids called \nhumors. \nIf you had too much yellow bile, you would be choleric (hot and dry) and angry all the time. The choleric is, \nroughly, the ruling type. \nIf you had too much phlegm, you would be phlegmatic (cold and wet) and be sluggish. This is roughly the \nleaning type. \nIf you had too much black bile – and we don't know what the Greeks were referring to here – you would be \nmelancholy (cold and dry) and tend to be sad constantly. This is roughly the avoiding type. \nAnd, if you had a lot of blood relative to the other humors, you be in a good humor, sanguine (warm and \nmoist). This naturally cheerful and friendly person represents the socially useful type. \nOne word of warning about Adler's types: Adler believed very strongly that each person is a unique \nindividual with his or her own unique lifestyle. The idea of types is, for him, only a heuristic device, \nmeaning a useful fiction, not an absolute reality! \nChildhood \nAdler, like Freud, saw personality or lifestyle as something established quite early in life. In fact, the \nprototype of your lifestyle tends to be fixed by about five years old. New experiences, rather than change \nthat prototype, tend to be interpreted in terms of the prototype, \"force fit,\" in other words, into preconceived \n9 | 14",

George Boeree: Personality Theories  Alfred Adler\nnotions, just like new acquaintances tend to get \"force fit\" into our stereotypes. \nAdler felt that there were three basic childhood situations that most contribute to a faulty lifestyle. The first \nis one we've spoken of several times: organ inferiorities, as well as early childhood diseases. They are what \nhe called \"overburdened,\" and if someone doesn't come along to draw their attention to others, they will \nremain focussed on themselves. Most will go through life with a strong sense of inferiority; A few will \novercompensate with a superiority complex. Only with the encouragement of loved ones will some truly \ncompensate. \nThe second is pampering. Many children are taught, by the actions of others, that they can take without \ngiving. Their wishes are everyone else's commands. This may sound like a wonderful situation, until you \nrealize that the pampered child fails in two ways: First, he doesn't learn to do for himself, and discovers later \nthat he is truly inferior; And secondly, he doesn't learn any other way to deal with others than the giving of \ncommands. And society responds to pampered people in only one way: hatred. \nThe third is neglect. A child who is neglected or abused learns what the pampered child learns, but learns it \nin a far more direct manner: They learn inferiority because they are told and shown every day tat they are of \nno value; They learn selfishness because they are taught to trust no one. If you haven't known love, you don't \ndevelop a capacity for it later. We should note that the neglected child includes not only orphans and the \nvictims of abuse, but the children whose parents are never there, and the ones raised in a rigid, authoritarian \nmanner. \nBirth order \nAdler must be credited as the first theorist to include not only a child's mother and father and other adults as \nearly influence on the child, but the child's brothers and sisters as well. His consideration of the effects of \nsiblings and the order in which they were born is probably what Adler is best-known for. I have to warn you, \nthough, that Adler considered birth-order another one of those heuristic ideas – useful fictions – that \ncontribute to understanding people, but must be not be taken too seriously. \nThe only child is more likely than others to be pampered, with all the ill results we've discussed. After all, \nthe parents of the only child have put all their eggs in one basket, so to speak, and are more likely to take \nspecial care – sometimes anxiety-filled care – of their pride and joy. If the parents are abusive, on the other \nhand, the only child will have to bear that abuse alone. \nThe first child begins life as an only child, with all the attention to him- or herself. Sadly, just as things are \ngetting comfortable, the second child arrives and \"dethrones\" the first. At first, the child may battle for his \nor her lost position. He or she might try acting like the baby – after all, it seems to work for the baby! – only \nto be rebuffed and told to grow up. Some become disobedient and rebellious, others sullen and withdrawn. \nAdler believes that first children are more likely than nay other to become problem children. More \npositively, first children are often precocious. They tend to be relatively solitary and more conservative than \nthe other children in the family. \nThe second child is in a very different situation: He or she has the first child as a sort of \"pace-setter,\" and \ntends to become quite competitive, constantly trying to surpass the older child. They often succeed, but many \nfeel as if the race is never done, and they tend to dream of constant running without getting anywhere. Other \n\"middle\" children will tend to be similar to the second child, although each may focus on a different \n\"competitor.\" \nThe youngest child is likely to be the most pampered in a family with more than one child. After all, he or \nshe is the only one who is never dethroned! And so youngest children are the second most likely source of \nproblem children, just behind first children. On the other hand, the youngest may also feel incredible \ninferiority, with everyone older and \"therefore\" superior. But, with all those \"pace-setters\" ahead, the \nyoungest can also be driven to exceed all of them. \nWho is a first, second, or youngest child isn't as obvious as it might seem.

They tend to be relatively solitary and more conservative than \nthe other children in the family. \nThe second child is in a very different situation: He or she has the first child as a sort of \"pace-setter,\" and \ntends to become quite competitive, constantly trying to surpass the older child. They often succeed, but many \nfeel as if the race is never done, and they tend to dream of constant running without getting anywhere. Other \n\"middle\" children will tend to be similar to the second child, although each may focus on a different \n\"competitor.\" \nThe youngest child is likely to be the most pampered in a family with more than one child. After all, he or \nshe is the only one who is never dethroned! And so youngest children are the second most likely source of \nproblem children, just behind first children. On the other hand, the youngest may also feel incredible \ninferiority, with everyone older and \"therefore\" superior. But, with all those \"pace-setters\" ahead, the \nyoungest can also be driven to exceed all of them.",
