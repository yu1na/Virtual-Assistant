He stated that he has been an assistant principal for two years. The first year \nhe received a few complaints about being inflexible and overbearing, but he and his principal \nattributed it to inexperience. In his second year, the complaints increased from both faculty and \nparents, and recently the principal and superintendent of the school district met with Jim to \ndiscuss the complaints. He was scheduled to meet with them in a few weeks to development a \n“growth plan.” Jim stated that the meeting with the principal and superintendent was a “wake up \ncall” and having done some reflection over the past week, he realized that many of the comments \nfrom faculty and parents were similar to ones expressed by several of the women he had dated. \nConsequently, he now realized he needed to take a hard look at how he related to others, \nalthough he did not know what that would entail. \nRichard Watts’ Way of Working with Jim from an Adlerian Perspective \nDeveloping and maintaining a strong, encouragement-focused counseling relationship with \nclients is crucial, and success in the subsequent phases of Adlerian counseling—assessment, \ninsight, reorientation—is predicated on the development of this respectful and egalitarian \nrelationship. I hoped to develop this kind of relationship with Jim so he would feel safe to \nexplore and respond to what brought him to counseling. \n\n Watts: Adlerian Case Study 2 \n \nAs part of the assessment process, I discovered that Jim’s father was an alcoholic and, \nalthough his parents stayed together until the father’s death when Jim was 18, he remembered his \nparents “fought constantly.” In addition, when Jim’s father was drunk, his was also verbally and \nphysically abusive to Jim’s mother, Jim, and his younger brother. Jim recalled that as early as \nfirst grade he experienced the expectation that he was to take care of his mother and, in many \nrespects, parent his younger brother. All of Jim’s early recollections centered on being scared \nabout “out of control” situations and feeling safe when he was “in charge.” Jim’s style of life \nconvictions could be summarized by the following syllogism: I must be strong, others are not \ntrustworthy or will let me down, the world is a scary place, therefore I must be in charge or life \nwill get out of control and overwhelm me.” As I understood it, Jim developed a dysfunctional \nconviction (or “basic mistake”) that, in order for his life to be manageable and for him to feel a \nsense of safety and security, he had to be in charge and be in control of his environment at all \ntimes. \nIn helping Jim gain insight or better understand this core conviction about control, I \nmight ask, “Could it be you only feel safe or comfortable when you are in control or in charge of \nthings?” I would seek to help him understand that some of his core beliefs may have enabled \nhim to survive when he was younger but are not working very well for him as a young adult. \nUseful questions here might include: “What benefits do you gain from always having to be in \ncontrol? What costs do you incur?” “How have people responded to you—both at work and in \ndating relationships—as you have interacted with them from an ‘in control’ and ‘in charge’ \nperspective?” “How do you think these beliefs will impact your future career and future \nrelationships?”",

Jim needs to consider alternative beliefs, behaviors, and, perhaps most importantly, \nmotivations for his actions. Merely understanding the dynamics of his behavior would not be \nadequate for Jim or any other client; he not only needs to consider behavior changes but \nimplement some of them as well.

Or, given his preference for structure, I might use the \n“Reflecting As If” (RAI) process that I developed. Using the RAI process, I would ask him to \ntake a reflective step back before moving forward to act as if. To begin this process, I would ask \nhim to reflect on and respond to the question: “How would you be different if you were acting as \nif you were the person you want to be?” We would than co-construct a list of ‘as if’ behaviors \nthat manifest him acting as if, rank them from least difficult to most, and then select a few for the \ncoming week.

For example, when he encounters a \n\n Watts: Adlerian Case Study 4 \n \nsituation in which he senses he needs to take charge—either at work or in a relationship, he can \ncatch himself and reflect on the best course of action prior to responding.
