The \"state\" of one's mind or how one thinks affects the body \nand vice versa. The mind can not be divided into various conflicting parts \nor sections (i.e., id, ego, superego). There is not a separate unconscious, \nbut rather the person remembers what he wants to remember and that \nwhich supports his style or view of life: how he perceives the world and \nhis place in it. A \"game\" I play with my students, to help them understand \nthe concept of holism, involves asking them to stand and raise their left \nhand and right leg. I ask them to circle their left hand in a clockwise \nmotion and then, at the same time, to circle their raised right leg in a \ncounter-clockwise motion. The students soon laugh because they find \nthat, without thinking about it, they begin to move their leg and hand in \nthe same direction! The analogy is that mind and body \"move\" together: \nas stated, a physical symptom affects one's state of mind, one's state of \nmind affects one's physical body and the world around him. Another \nimage that also helps to understand the concept of holism is that of a car. \nA car is made of many parts but all the parts work together so that it can \nmove in one direction. \nFor example, a client of mine, age ten, had trouble walking. He was \noften sick and \"blue.\" A medical checkup revealed no medical causation. \nHowever, not being able to walk and often being sick and blue enabled \nhim not to attend school, where he was pressured to join a gang and sell \n\n \n \ndrugs. Being sick also prompted his grandmother, with whom he lived, to \npity him and pamper him, provide him with his favorite meals and buy \nhim a television set that she could not afford — all in efforts to cheer him \nup. The client had \"arranged\" his symptoms holistically and purposely — \nif unconsciously, or out of his awareness — to evade school and \"get\" \ngoodies (please note that \"unconsciously\" is an adverb denoting \"without \nawareness\" and should not be confused with the psycho-analytic term \"the \nunconscious\"). \nGoal directed Behavior \nThe above example demonstrating holism, that mind and body move \ntogether, also suggests goal oriented behavior, or what the Greeks called \nteleology: to what or to which goal(s) is one's behavior directed? For what \nmeans? If a person were lost, would another person ask that lost person \n\"From where did you come?\" No, the lost person would be asked \"Where \nare you going?\" Knowing a client's direction or goals helps a therapist to \nunderstand how that client views life. A therapist who knows his client's \ndirection or goal(s) can suggest more positive behaviors to enact to reach \nthat goal. For example, a client whose goal is to be more powerful than \nothers can bully others — or can gain that power through knowledge, say, \neducation, and help and lead others. \nGoal orientation, thus, suggests movement and purpose: that all \nbehavior is purposeful, toward a goal or set of goals. Even if a person \nappears to act conflicted, we must ask what is the direction or movement \n— the goal, purpose — of that conflict. Often, the goal is to stay stuck in \nthe same rut or to confound others.

What was our position in \nour family-of-origin and early neighborhood, vis-a-vis others, and how \nhave we \"carried\" this into adulthood?

Did we follow or rebel against the values that were \npresented? For example, the parents of a client of mine valued education, \nboth parents having advanced degrees. My client followed this \"guiding \nline\" and went to college; his sister rejected this value and, to carve out \nher own personality and/or make herself significant in her family in a \ndifferent way, did not attend college. Recently I attended a lecture given \nby a famous American newscaster who spoke about her early life and the \nvalues of her family. Both of her parents had rejected religion. However, \nthe family of her best early school age friend embraced religion.

This \nidea of choice — individual choice — presumes that Adlerian psychology \nis a psychology of use and not possession: that is, Adlerians consider \n\"how we use what we have.\" For example, a person is born into wealth. \nDoes-that person use that position to exploit or to help others? A person \nis born into poverty, or is sexually abused. Does that person continue the \ncycle of poverty or make choices to get out of poverty? Does the person \nwho is sexually abused thus sexually abuse others or choose another \nroute? A person becomes crippled. How does that person \"use\" that \nillness? To blame others? To expect pity from others? To bear a grudge? \nTo be depressed? Or, does that person make different choices: to make \nthe best of his or her situation and to contribute to the well-being of \nothers? \nThis idea of how one uses what one has also includes one's hereditary \nor biological make-up.

So I put a little step stool by the counter and I stood up and \nthere was a bottle of mustard — a jar of mustard — and I put in my fingers \nthere and tasted it and fell backwards. It was a god-awful taste but I thought \nsomething was being kept from me.\" \nAge: \"Under five years old, not in kindergarten.\" Most Vivid Moment: \n\"Watching myself do it.\" \nWatching yourself? \n\"Deliberately walking up the step stool to disobey.

A feeling that I \nknew I was doing something that I shouldn't.\" \nRose's ER 5 \n\"You know how they used to pull teeth out? Pull it around a tooth and tie \nit to the door. That was terror. I remember my brother Tommy screaming on \nthe floor when the string was tied to his tooth. And then you slammed the \ndoor.\" \nSlammed the door? \n\"My mom or dad. And him being held down.
