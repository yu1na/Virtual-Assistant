    "text": "Alfred Adler: Individual Psychology \n \nSummary Outline \n \nI.Overview of Adler's Individual Psychology \nAdler was an original member of Freud's psychoanalytic \ngroup, but he never saw himself as a disciple or a follower of \nFreud. If fact, throughout his life he carried with him the \nnote Freud had sent to him proposing the establishment of \nan organization of physicians. Adler saw the invitation as \nFreud's recognition of Adler as an equal. After Adler broke \nfrom that group, he built a theory of personality that was \nnearly diametrically opposed to that of Freud. Whereas \nFreud's view of humanity was pessimistic and rooted in \nbiology, Adler's view was optimistic, idealistic, and rooted in \nfamily experiences. \n \nII.Biography of Alfred Adler \nAlfred Adler was born in 1870 in a Viennese suburb, a second \nson of middle-class Jewish parents. Like Freud, Adler was a \nphysician, and in 1902, he became a charter member of \nFreud's organization. However, personal and professional \ndifferences between the two men led to Adler's departure \nfrom the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society in 1911. Adler soon \nfounded his own group, the Society for Individual \nPsychology. Adler's strengths were his energetic oral \npresentations and his insightful ability to understand family \ndynamics. He was not a gifted writer, a limitation that may \nhave prevented him from attaining world recognition equal \nto that of Freud. \n \nIII.Introduction to Adlerian Theory \nAlthough Adler's individual psychology is both complex and \ncomprehensive, its main tenets can be stated in simple form. \n \nIV.Striving for Success or Superiority \nThe sole dynamic force behind people's actions is the striving \nfor success or superiority. \n \nA. The Final Goal \nThe final goal of success or superiority toward which all \npeople strive unifies personality and makes all behavior \nmeaningful. \n \nB. The Striving Force as Compensation \nBecause people are born with small, inferior bodies, \nthey feel inferior and attempt to overcome these feelings \nthrough \ntheir \nnatural \ntendency \nto \nmove \ntoward \ncompletion. The striving force can take one of two courses—\npersonal gain (superiority) or community benefit (success). \n \nC. Striving for Personal Superiority \nPsychologically unhealthy individuals strive for personal \nsuperiority with little concern for other people. Although \nthey may appear to be interested in other people, their basic \nmotivation is personal benefit. \n \nD. Striving for Success \nIn contrast, psychologically healthy people strive for the \nsuccess of all humanity, but they do so without losing their \npersonal identity. \n \nV.Subjective Perceptions \nPeople's subjective view of the world—not reality—shapes \ntheir behavior. \n \nA. Fictionalism \nFictions are people's expectations of the future. Adler held \nthat fictions guide behavior, because people act as if these \nfictions \nare \ntrue. \n Adler \nemphasized teleology over causality, or explanations of \nbehavior in terms of future goals rather than past causes. \n \nB. Physical Inferiorities \nAdler believed that all humans are \"blessed\" with physical \ninferiorities, which stimulate subjective feelings of inferiority \nand move people toward perfection or completion. \n \nVI.Unity and Self-Consistency of Personality \nAdler believed that all behaviors are directed toward a single \npurpose. When seen in the light of that sole purpose, \nseemingly contradictory behaviors can be seen as operating \nin a self-consistent manner. \n \nA. Organ Dialect \nPeople often use a physical disorder to express style of life, a \ncondition Adler called organ dialect, or organ jargon. \n \nB. Conscious and Unconscious \nConscious and unconscious processes are unified and \noperate to achieve a single goal. The part of our goal that is \nnot clearly understood is unconscious; that part of our goal \nwe fail to fully comprehend is conscious. \n \nVII.Social Interest \nHuman behavior has value to the extent that it is motivated \nby social interest, that is, a feeling of oneness with all of \nhumanity. \n \nA. Origins of Social Interest \nAlthough social interest exists as potentiality in all people, it \nmust be fostered in a social environment. Adler believed that \nthe parent-child relationship can be so strong that it negates \nthe effects of heredity. \n \nB. Importance of Social Interest \nAccording to Adler, social interest is \"the sole criterion of \nhuman values,\" and the worthiness of all one's actions must \nbe seen by this standard.

    "text": "IX.Creative Power \nStyle of life is partially a product of heredity and \nenvironment—the building blocks of personality—but \nultimately style of life is shaped by people's creative \npower, that is, by their ability to freely choose a course of \naction. \n \nX.Abnormal Development \nCreative power is not limited to healthy people; unhealthy \nindividuals also create their own personalities. Thus, each of \nus is free to choose either a useful or a useless style of life. \n \nA. General Description \nThe most important factor in abnormal development is lack \nof social interest. In addition, people with a useless style of \nlife tend to (1) set their goals too high, (2) have a dogmatic \nstyle of life, and (3) live in their own private world. \n \nB. External Factors in Maladjustment \nAdler listed three factors that relate to abnormal \ndevelopment: (1) exaggerated physical defects, which do \nnot by themselves cause abnormal development, but which \nmay contribute to it by generating subjective and \nexaggerated feelings of inferiority; (2) a pampered style of \nlife, which contributes to an overriding drive to establish a \npermanent parasitic relationship with the mother or a \nmother substitute; and (3) a neglected style of life, which \nleads to distrust of other people. \n \nC. Safeguarding Tendencies \nBoth normal and neurotic people create symptoms as a \nmeans \nprotecting \ntheir \nfragile \nself-esteem. \nThese safeguarding tendencies maintain a neurotic life style \nand protect a person from public disgrace. The three \nprincipal safeguarding tendencies are (1) excuses, which \nallow people to preserve their inflated sense of personal \nworth; \n(2) aggression, \nwhich \nmay \ntake \nthe \nform \nof depreciating others' accomplishments, accusing others of \nbeing responsible for one's own failures, or self-accusation; \nand \n(3) withdrawal, \nwhich \ncan \nbe \nexpressed \nby \npsychologically moving backward, standing still,hesitating, \nor constructing obstacles \n \nD. Masculine Protest \nBoth men and women sometimes overemphasize the \ndesirability of being manly, a condition Adler called \nthe masculine protest. The frequently found inferior \nstatus of women is not based on physiology but on \nhistorical developments and social learning. Boys are \noften taught early that being masculine means being \ncourageous, strong, and dominant. The ultimate \naccomplishment for boys is to win, to be powerful, to be \non top. In contrast, girls often learn to be passive and to \naccept an inferior position in society. In contrast to Adler's \nmore democratic attitude, Freud believed that anatomy is \ndestiny and that women occupy the 'dark continent\" of \npsychology. Near the end of his life, Freud was still asking \nwhat women wanted. According to Adler, Freud's \nattitudes toward women would be evidence of a person \nwith a strong masculine protest. In contrast to Freud's \nviews on women, Adler assumed that women—because \nthey have the same physiological and psychological needs \nas men—want more or less the same things that men want. \n \nXI.Applications of Individual Psychology \nAdler applied the principles of individual psychology to \nfamily constellation, early recollections, dreams, and \npsychotherapy. \n \nA. Family Constellation \nAdler believed that people's perception of how they fit into \ntheir family is related to their style of life. He claimed that \nfirstborns are likely to have strong feelings of power and \nsuperiority, to be overprotective, and to have more than \ntheir share of anxiety. Secondborn children (such as Adler) \nare likely to have strong social interest, provided they do not \nget trapped trying to overcome their older sibling. Youngest \nchildren are likely to be pampered and to lack \nindependence, whereas only children have some of the \ncharacteristics of both the oldest and the youngest child. \n \nB. Early Recollections \nA more reliable method of determining style of life is to ask \npeople for their earliest recollections. Adler believed that \nearly memories are templates on which people project their \ncurrent style of life. These recollections need not be \naccurate accounts of early event, but true or false, they \nhave psychological importance because they reflect a \nperson's current view of the world. \n \nC. Dreams \nAdler believed that dreams can provide clues to solving \nfuture problems. However, dreams are disguised to deceive \nthe dreamer and usually must be interpreted by another \nperson. \n \nD. Psychotherapy \nThe goal of Adlerian therapy is to create a relationship \nbetween therapist and patient that fosters social interest.",
