This paper will detail the concepts of individual \npsychology pertaining to Jen’s case.\nPresenting Concern\nOne of the week’s methods applied to conceptualize Jen’s case is Individual \nPsychology, developed by Adler. According to Robey et al. (2017), this is a \nshort-term goal-oriented method, which is suitable for this case because Jen \nonly has one concern, and she has already identified the potential cause of the \nissue. Hence, the goal of therapy would be to uncover Jen’s attitudes towards \nmen and help her develop a sense of trust. In that way, she will be able to date \nand communicate with men without fear of being abandoned. Moreover, Robey \net al. (2017) state that Adler believed that the individual’s happiness is not the \nresult of the unconscious mind or the outside influences because “people have \nthe power to change their own lives” (p. 282). Hence, this method will help Jen \ntake control of her dating life and view her relationship with men constructively.\n@2025 11 19\n\nThe client’s basic concerns are her relationship with men and her inability to \ntrust them. As Jen identified, due to the fact that her father left them, she has \nbeen feeling guilty. Moreover, she has lost a connection with her father. \nCurrently, Jen wants to date men, but she sees her relationship with her father \nas an issue that does not allow her to experience these relationships fully.\nBased on the identified concern, it is best to address Jen’s view of herself and \nthe men she dates. Adlerian theory primarily focuses on how a person fits into \nsociety and how potential feelings of inferiority or other negative thoughts \naffect this process (Robey et al., 2017). Hence, the first goal would be to \ndetermine if Jen feels inferior to the men she dates and whether her view of \nrelationships can be adjusted to the one that would not obstruct her from \ndating.\nThree Central Concepts\nOne central concept of the approach is social interest, which is the feeling of \ncommunity and belonging with others. This theory is rooted in the individual’s \ncooperation with others and their ability to maintain social relations (Robey et \nal., 2017). Hence, the main idea is to reorient the client’s beliefs in a way that \nbenefits their social interest. According to Rhinehart and Gibbons (2017), under \nthis theory, individuals may experience isolation, self-absorption, and \nwithdrawal that hinder their ability to date. Relationships with others are an \nevident social interest that can be hindered by negative perceptions and ideas.\nThis concept is relevant to working with Jen and understanding her case \nbecause she experiences an evident social struggle, which is communication \nwith men. On the one hand, she wants to date, but on the other, she blames her \nfather for her lack of trust in men. One example of how this theory can help is \nby reorienting Jen’s focus and her belief that she cannot trust men towards a \nmore positive attitude that allows her to communicate with the opposite sex \nfreely.\nThe second concept of Individual Psychology is goals, which refers to the \nclient’s wishes and what they want to achieve through the therapeutic sessions. \nA common goal of this therapy method is to help clients understand their \nbehavior patterns and thoughts (Yee, 2018). Additionally, this therapy method \nemphasizes the need to set specific targets that the client wants to achieve \nover the course of the sessions, which helps the therapist set the structure and \nfocus of the sessions.",

    "text": "The concept of goals is relevant to working with Jen because she has clearly \nidentified a problem that obstructs her from living her life as she wants, which \nis her mistrust of men. Jen wants to date and experience the interactions with \nothers fully, which can be done by addressing her mistrust. Hence, the concept \nof setting goals and enhancing her understanding of her thoughts and patterns \nwill help her improve her romantic life.\nThe final concept of this theory reviewed in this paper is the feeling of \ninferiority, which is an important element of psychosocial development. \nAccording to Rhinehart and Gibbons (2017), unlike Freud, Adler did not focus on\nthe person’s psychosexual development; and instead, he emphasized the \npsychological development of an individual in the context of society and social \ninteractions. Moreover, with this theory, “individuals are not simply a number of \nparts but holistic beings who create meaning from the social contexts within \nwhich they are actively involved” (Rhinehart & Gibbons, 2017, p. 181). Hence, \nthe interaction between a person and their social environment is central under \nthis method, and the feeling of inferiority may obstruct proper communication.\nThis concept is applicable to Jen’s case because her problem is rooted in the \nbarriers she experiences when interacting with romantic partners. Hence, by \nexploring her feeling of inferiority in this aspect, she can learn to build \nmeaningful relationships with others, regardless of her past negative \nexperiences. Hence, her main struggle is her cooperation and communication \nwith others, and because this method is rooted in the development of a person \nin the context of society, it is suitable for this client.\nStrengths and Limitations\nThe two strengths of the Individual Psychology for working with Jen are the \nshort-term nature of this method and the goal orientation. Jen only has one \ncentral concern that currently affects her life. Hence, she does not need \nprolonged therapy to improve her well-being. Moreover, goal orientation can \nhelp set a target, for example, “to learn to trust men” or “to understand that \nrelationships end.” Therefore, after several sessions, Jen will be able to receive \nthe result she wants without having to attend therapy for months.\nThe two weaknesses of this approach are the lack of in-depth analysis and a \nneed to choose a different method if Jen discovers other issues she wants to \nwork on. Since this is a short-term therapy method, if, over the course of \ntherapy, Jen uncovers other issues that may obstruct her personal life, there \n\nwill be a need to change the approach towards a more in-depth analysis of the \nunconscious mind. For example, Jen may discover that apart from not trusting \nmen, she blames herself for the relationship failure and fears going on dates \ndue to this.\nReflection\nI can use the goal-setting method to understand my own relationship patterns \nand personal life since, through this analysis, I have learned that despite the \npopularity of psychoanalytic techniques, there are methods that can help \nrapidly improve one’s life and well-being. According to Rhinehart and Gibbons \n(2017), “romantic separation can negatively affect their emotional state, social \nrelationships, and understanding of personal identity” (p. 181). Prior to this \nassignment, I was aware that I am cautious about dating, and the cause may be \nlinked to rejections I experienced in the past. However, this approach can help \nreorient my beliefs and help me feel more comfortable.\nOne challenge I encountered when trying to apply the goal-setting aspect to my \npersonal life is understanding the most appropriate goal. For example, I want to \ndevelop more meaningful relationships with others. However, I think that I \nwould need to consult a specialist to explore better my understanding of the \nmeaningfulness and expectations from relationships. Hence, this theory is an \nexcellent method to analyze one’s social interests. However, it is challenging to \napply it without the guidance of a specialist.\nThis approach is culturally responsive since the therapy focuses on the \nindividual’s place in society. According to Yee (2018), a sign of a good theory is \nits applicability across different issues and age groups, as well as its cultural \nresponsiveness. Since this theory explores a person’s place within a society, it \nis natural that Adlerian theory is suitable for working with a set of culturally \ndiverse clients because of its flexibility and orientation on the person’s place \nwithin a society. Moreover, the client’s personal goals matter under this theory \nas well, which means that the therapist must consider how the individual’s \nculture defines their social interactions.",
