Yet, Adler inspired the name of his theory from the \nLatin word, “individuum”2, that is; indivisible for the fact that he attempts to eschew reductionist views on \nhumans. Thus, he opts for a holistic approach that perceives persons as a unity and a whole rather than a \nmere collection of body parts, as Adler states, “very early in my work, I found man to be a [self-consistent] \nunity.

This latter, being it physical or environmental \nmay create feelings of inferiority which is a normal human experience resulting in a process of striving for \nsuperiority and development of one’s self. Striving hence becomes a leading force for all individuals who \ntend to defeat their feelings of inferiority by striving toward constancy and affinity with their life aspirations \nand ideal self. This alignment is basically manifested through creativeness, success, proficiency, fulfillment, \nand perfection. Adler’s theory is firstly listed among the early exemplars of positive theories for the fact that \nit explores humans’ realization of their true potentials throughout an ongoing process of becoming. \nAccording to Adler, if we are to understand why people behave the way they do, we must first recognize that \nhumans have a tendency to strive after self-created goals. “The first thing we discover in the psychic trends is \nthat the movements are directed toward a goal; this teleology, striving for goals, is innate in the concept of \nadaptation” (Alfred Adler, 1927, p. 28). \nSubsequently, all individuals hold a multitude of goals and objectives with respect to various aspects of their \nlives, and the choice of these goals is originally structured by a higher order goal called our self-ideal. That \nis, a perfect representation of the ideal type of oneself people dream of becoming, and its formation begins \nearly in childhood. Adler’s aspect of the self-ideal plays a crucial role in human’s individual psychological \ngrowth, in that it influences their striving for superiority, which, according to Adler, is the fundamental drive \nbehind human behavior. In other words, we are naturally driven to improve our perception in life to gain \nmore advantageous positions, or as Adler Seymour put it, “the material of life has been constantly bent on \nreaching a plus from minus situation” (Adler S, 1984, p. 97). \nStriving for superiority is innate, thus the specific manifestations of this striving are determined by the \ncontentedness of the person’s self-ideal and the extent to which he or she seeks to actualize it. Therefore, one \nof the paramount conceptions of Adler’s individual psychology is that propounded in what he terms ‘life \nstyle’, which is the subjective, unarticulated set of guidelines and principles individuals develop and often \nuse to move them through life and toward their goals. (Harold H. Mosak, Michael P. Maniacci, 1999, p. \n47).That is to say, as we go through life, we learn what type of behaviours and thought patterns that \ndistinctly guide us towards our self-ideal and which hinder us, thus accordingly we develop our life style. \nFurthermore, Adler highlights the notion that it is inadequate, in a priori manner, to judge a lifestyle for \nbeing healthy or unhealthy and normal or abnormal, whilst it can only be observed in action and see what \nsuccess it manifests. For Adler, there is no such thing called “normal” life style; “Every Life style is \nadequate, until life presents it with a task for which it is not prepared; it is at those times that its weak points \nemerge.” (Harold Mosak and Michael Maniacci, 1997, p. 58) \nThe weak points in humans’ life styles usually frustrate their pursuit of superiority and trigger feelings of \ninferiority that are based on their self-concept, or, in other words, the subjective evaluations individuals \nconcretize of themselves, and the conclusions they draw with respect to their abilities and potentials to reach \ntheir life goals. Inferiority feelings are often induced by what Adler calls ‘objective inferiorities’, these are \nbased on some measurable standards in juxtaposition to others; for example, people may objectively feel \ninferior when it comes to their strength or height, the amount of money they earn or their skills at a given \nactivity. However, an objective inferiority only triggers feeling of inferiority if it is somehow substantial to \npeople striving after superiority and reaching a self-ideal. Another inferiority that Adler explores is called \nOrgan Inferiority, which is considered as the basis of human striving, especially in cases of inherent diseases \nor psychical defects; Adler wrote that \"the organs most disturbed are those which have been made \nsusceptible by some inherited weakness.\" (1956, p. 287) In this context, it is requisite to provide ones’ self an \nappropriate compensation to overcome such inferiority in an effective manner.",

Coping behaviours can also be divided into two types: direct \nproblem solving and compensation.

That is, we seek new ways to make up for our \ninferiority by excelling in a manner which can compensate for our deficits. For instance, individuals who \nlose their auditory perception may substitute it by cultivating the ability to read lips. \nSafeguarding Behaviors \nMany people however tend to refuse addressing their issues in such manner and so turn to safeguarding \nbehaviors. These are often deployed in the attempt to convince one and others that certain obstacles which lie \noutside of their control contribute in impeding their progress. Adler claims that safeguarding behaviors \nresemble to the sideshows that are displayed at a circus for they are utilized for the sake of distracting \nattention away from the most stressing issues in life and direct it instead to trivial ones. In addition, \nSafeguarding behaviors take a variety of forms the most crucial of which are the Construction of Obstacles; \n“These are less severe cases, in which the individual always manages somehow to be active in life and may \neven be prominent”. (Heinzl. Ansbacher, Rowena R. Ansbacher, 1964, p. 275) Put differently, some people \nmanifest specific physical issues, such as headaches or chronic tiredness while others develop anxiety \ndisorders and fear as a pretext for their inability to face up to their challenges. \nAnother form of Safeguarding behaviors is what Adler labels as Distance Seeking which entails \nprocrastination or merely taking the smallest steps forward before going back to ones’ confront zone. \nNevertheless, given the fact that most people use safeguarding behaviors to one degree or another, they may \nbe of big problem when they are overly used and for too long. As for Adler, those who tend to rely on \nsafeguarding behaviors are “pitiful individuals who make use of transparent tricks in order to escape life \nduties”. (Henri Ellenberger, 1970, p. 596) \nAs a result, Safe guarding behaviors are never reliable and take only short time and will eventually lose \ntheir effectiveness. Thus, people have two options; either they start addressing their issues head on, or they can \neasily withdraw from the challenge and hence develop what Adler calls an inferiority complex. \nThe inferiority [symptom] complex describes the attitude of an individual who by \nthis complex expresses that he is not in the position to solve an existing problem. It \nmust not be confused with the inferiority feeling. The inferiority [symptom] \ncomplex is the presentation of the person to himself and others that he is not strong \nenough to solve a given problem in a socially useful way. Needless to say, no point \nof rest is given in this way. The total mood with all its thought, feeling, and action \nmaterial is continued into failure. (Heinzl. Ansbacher, Rowena R. Ansbacher, 1964, \np. 250) \nCorrespondingly, in order to evade such fate, individuals must cease believing and relying on safeguarding \nbehaviors while they are able to stand tall and directly confront life challenges. Adler contends that \nsometimes people have recourse to safeguarding behaviors for the fact that they have adopted an overly \nperfectionist self-ideal which is unconducive to a balanced life style, so being more aware of one’s life goals \nand adjusting ourselves to a realistic self-ideal is a decisive step toward self-improvement. \nHowever, individual psychology stresses on humans’ free will to learn to be more courageous regardless \nhow unrealistic their self-ideal can be. As Adler states, “only those are able to muster the courage to advance \non the useful side who consider themselves a part of the whole, who are at home on this earth and in this \nmankind.” (Adler, 1956, p. 159) Adler considers the process of cultivating a courageous attitude among \npeople as the most basic concern of psychotherapy. Courage is not a faculty one either possesses or lack \nrather it is the willingness to engage in a risk taking conduct regardless its consequences provided that we are",

What matters, and what matters only is what \nwe do with the problems.”(Susan Cheever, 2004, p. 43) \nSocial Interests \nGardner Murphy indicates in his Historical Introduction to Modern Psychology that “Adler’s psychology \nwas the first psychological system in the history of psychology that was developed in what we should today \ncall a social-science direction.” (1982, p. 341). Adlerian psychology is essentially founded on the social \naspect of human nature. Based on Adler’s experiences during the First World War, he draws on the \nimportance of the social context of his theory to the extent that he is convinced that human survival is \ndependent on several humanistic reforms most essential of which constitute his Individual Psychology. \nTherefore, there is an existing discrepancy between Sigmund Freud psychoanalysis and Adler’s Individual \nPsychology. This latter highlights the concept of social interest as the pinnacle of humans’ psychological \ndevelopment and identifies social behavior as the driving force, rather than Freud’s sexual drives and libido. \nAdler gives prominence to environmental and societal agency, and focuses on teleology over causality, that \nis, expounding human behavior in terms of future goals more than past causes. Adler advances that \nindividuals are socially embedded hence they cannot be adequately examined apart from their social \nbackground. Thereby, our social interest is basically related to Adlerian aspects on the tasks of life which are \nlove, society, work, spirituality, and self. Humans explore certain relationship within each task; that is to say; \nas we go through life, we experience love relationships, relationships with friends, at work, relationship with \nourselves, and with God or the universe. Similarly to Adler’s view, \nDarwin already pointed out that one never finds weak animals living alone. Man \nmust be included among these, particularly because he is not strong enough to live \nalone. He has only little resistance against nature, he needs a larger amount of aids to \nlive and preserve himself. Now we can understand that man could maintain himself \nonly when he placed himself under particularly favorable conditions. These, \nhowever, were afforded to him only by group life. Group life proved to be a \nnecessity because it alone enabled man, through a division of labor, to solve \nproblems in which the individual as such would have been condemned to failure. \n(Heinzl. Ansbacher, Rowena R. Ansbacher, 1964, p. 129) \nAccording to Adler, Social interest or community feeling is the genuine and inevitable compensation for \nmost human natural deficiencies. Indeed, Individuals, even biologically regarded, are intrinsically social \nbeings, since they need a sense of belongings to a group or a community within which “the feeling of worth \nand value is heightened, giving courage and an optimistic view, and there is a sense of acquiescence in the \ncommon advantages and drawbacks of our lot. The individual feels at home in life and feels his existence to \nbe worthwhile just so far as he is useful to others.” (Heinzl. Ansbacher, Rowena R. Ansbacher, 1964, p. 155) \nAdrian psychology is known for its holistic, theological and phenomenological perspectives given that it \nhighlights humans’ psychological development, striving for superiority and social interests. Even though \nAdler has not received a high recognition compared to Freud psychoanalysis, his influence is clearly seen \nwithin humanistic psychology. “Adler once proclaimed that he was more concerned that his theories \nsurvived than that people remembered to associate his theories with his name”.(Mosak, 1989, p. 69) The \nmain premise of Adler’s theory resides in his conviction that the source of humans’ suffering is not to be \nfound in the way life challenges us, but rather in the solutions people endorse to face such challenges. \n \nReferences/Bibliography \nMosak, H.
